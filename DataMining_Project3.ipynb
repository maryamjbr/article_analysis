METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.\",\n          \"250 words VIRAL ETIOLOGY AND OUTCOME OF SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS AMONG CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO THE PICU ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the viral etiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their clinical significance and prognosis among critically ill children.\\nPatients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded.\\nMain variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded.\\nResults: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV.

Summary This study applied molecular-based method to investigate the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in 59 commercial pig farms in South Korea. The results of RT-PCR screening on a relatively large collection of faeces samples (n = 681) from January 2013 to March 2015 did not reveal the presence of PDCoV until the end of 2014. However, on March 2015, PDCoV-positive samples (SL2, SL5) were detected from SL swine farm in Gyeongbuk province. The phylogenetic trees based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related to the US PDCoV strains rather than those in China. Thought Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) grouped within US PDCoV cluster, the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes suggested that they are different.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 Background On December 31 st , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] .\\nOver the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3] . In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum readiness level [4] . As of April 24, France is the 6 th most severely affected country in the world (in terms of absolute numbers), with approximately 120,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5] . With about 6,000 deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].\\nThe first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 th [7] : in a series of 18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7] [8] [9] [10] .\\nCancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of severe outcome [8, 10] .

Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19\\nwere hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external intensive care units.\\nSurgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (\\\"plan blanc\\\") required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by learned societies [12] , included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.\\nMedical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national guidelines for breast cancer patients [12] : ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to 75 mg/m 2 . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and everolimus.

Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were systematically reduced by one half and were discontinued whenever possible.\\nRadiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was hypofractionated whenever possible [12, 13] Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the French society of palliative care [14] .\\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms, but subsequently became available to all cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the viral RdRp gene. All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [16, 17] , the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, focal consolidation and linear consolidation. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans. Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [19]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (0: no involvement; 1: \\u226410% of lung volumes; 2: 11-25%; 3: \\u226526% involvement).

Starting from March 13th, 2020, all proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered, as the registry also allowed for clinical follow-up phone calls scheduled at days 8, 14 and 28. More frequent and/or longer follow-up was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also registered and prospectively followed. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 th , 2020. This report was written according to the STROBE checklist.\\nThree populations were considered: patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR (positive RNA test); patients who had a positive RNA test or for whom RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but suggestive radiologic findings (COVID-19 patients); patients with symptoms only. Main outcome of patients were defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor analysis was performed. As a sensitivity analysis, prognostic factor analysis of death only was performed. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.\\nFrom March 13 th , 2020 to April 25 th , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in Figure 1A . RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41 patients) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings (N=18 patients).

Figure 1B .\\nBreast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1 . Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients (17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension (36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).\\nAbout two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing anti-cancer treatments were representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).\\nClinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 2 . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the 59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm 3 ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. The most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities, observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. Figure 2 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease: no significant association was observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19 lung disease.\\nAll patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home.

The flow of COVID-19 patients during the the course disease is shown in Figure 3 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24 th , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nNoteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).\\nFurther details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Supplementary Table 1 .\\nAn exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19 population showed that only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). They remained as prognostic factors in the RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast cancer patients.\\nWhile 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [20]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients, as a whole, are not at high risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This apparent low incidence could possibly be attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been All rights reserved.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.\\nIn terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the subgroup with positive RNA tests. As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.\\nWhile lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus of attention to define patients at high risk.

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.\\nMucosal immunity plays an important role in prevention of invasion by pathogens, which could be induced via systemic or mucosal immunization.\\nHowever, both immunization protocols require an effective adjuvant to produce better immune responses.\\nMucosally delivered antigen in the absence of an adjuvant usually induces either a low or undetectable antigen-specific immune response or results in immune tolerance [7, 43] . At present, a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States or elsewhere. Examples include oral vaccines, which mostly comprise live attenuated antigens, against Poliovirus [29] , V. cholerae, Salmonella typhi [22] , and Rotavirus [14] , and a nasal vaccine against influenza virus [3] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective mucosal adjuvant is a high priority in the development of efficient mucosal vaccine.\\nA synthetic dsRNA, termed Poly(I:C), has been found be able to boost immune responses since the 1960s [10, 45] . Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).\\nPIKA is a particular derivative of Poly (I:C) comprising kanamycin and calcium chloride [25] specific IgG and IFN-\\u03b3 responses in mice [33] . Most recent studies also showed that PIKA can provide broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses and coadministration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic H5N1 subunit vaccine can lead to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvements of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice [18, 19] .\\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of this \\nProduct [24] was inactivated with formaldehyde. PIKA is an improved adjuvant formulation comprising a derivative of Poly(I:C), kanamycin and calcium chloride [23, 33] , which was manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices by NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore.\\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Hubei CDC and maintained in SPF environment throughout the experiment. The mice were immunized through either an intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV or 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV plus the indicated dose of PIKA. Mice immunized with PBS served as a negative control. The protocol for intranasal immunization required the mice to be anesthetized slightly with sodium pentobarbital and held inverted with nose up until droplets of vaccine that were applied to both external nares were completely inhaled [13] . All intranasally immunizing reagents were suspended with PBS. Individual mice received 10 \\u00b5L of inoculants for five times with a 30 min resting interval between inoculations (total volume, 50 \\u00b5L). For intraperitoneal immunization, vaccine compositions were adjusted with PBS to a consistent 200 \\u00b5L dose. Each mouse received three immunizations with a 2-week interval between each immunization.\\nAll samples were collected two weeks after the final immunization as previously described [9] . Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital plexus puncture. Saliva was obtained after intraperitoneal injection with 20\\u00b5g of carbamylcholine chloride. The vaginal tract of individual mice was washed with 30\\u00b5L PBS for three times, with a total volume of 90\\u00b5L. After removing feces, small intestine tissues were weighed, cut into small pieces, mixed with PBS (100 mg of small intestine in 200\\u00b5L of PBS), and rocked at 4\\u2103 for 5 h. For collection of lung washing fluid, the trachea was exposed surgically and the oral portion of trachea was clamped, a 1-mL syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle was inserted into the trachea, 200\\u00b5L of PBS was injected into the peripheral airways, and five cycles of aspiration and injection were repeated [36] . After centrifugation at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min, supernatants of all samples were collected and stored at -80\\u00b0C before antibody detection.\\nThe anti-SARS-CoV titer of each sample was determined by ELISA.

However, no specific sIgA titer could be detected in lung washing fluid (Fig.   3A ) although neutralizing activity could be detected in the lung (Fig. 2D) . One concern was how the the lung \\nWe also assayed the SARS-CoV specific IgG in the pooled mucosal samples as well as in the serum samples\\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 4 .

A parenterally administered viruslike particle even elicited 90% to 100% efficacy against infection and pre-invasive disease in previously uninfected individuals [15] .\\nFor determining correlation between neutralizing activity and antibody in serum and mucosal secretion, both IgG and IgA responses in serum and in mucosal secretion were tested. In our study, neutralizing activity was detected in lung samples from three groups of mice, in which only specific IgG but not IgA could be detected (Fig. 2-4) . Antibody analysis also indicated that it was specific IgG but not specific IgA response at mucosal sites that was correlated with neutralizing activity. It is very possible that mucosal IgG could also play an important role in contributing to the neutralizing activity at mucosal sites. It has been propose [41] , serum IgG induced in parenteral immunization could find its way to the mucosae to exert protective effects. The relatively high concentrations of IgG seen at particular mucosal sites may reflect a combination of constitutive transcellular or paracellular transport from the systemic compartment and specific transport mechanism [41] .\\nTherefore, detection of IgG response in mucosal sites is also useful for evaluation of mucosal immune response and related neutralizing activity.\\nBecause SARS-CoV infection occurs at mucosal surfaces, such as lung, digestive surfaces and even vaginal surface [20, 21, 26, 38, 40] , the induction of a neutralizing activity which could block virus attachment and infection is more important in SARS-CoV prevention. Our study showed that PIKA was effective at inducing neutralizing activity at mucosal sites when co-administered by intraperitoneal and intranasal immunization (Fig. 2) . Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA. This may partially result from certain loss of vaccine antigen, dilution by mucosal secretion, capture by mucus gels, attack by proteases and nucleases, or exclusion by epithelial cells when delivered through mucosal routes [30] .\\nHowever, it should be noted that intranasal immunization could induce much higher specific IgA responses than intraperitoneal immunization. Many studies already demonstrated that mucosal sIgA can inhibit viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular virus neutralization, and transepithelial transport of immune complexes [17, 28, 44] . Even rotavirus VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies that lack neutralizing activity can protect mice against infection by] rotavirus via an intracellular neutralization mechanism [5] . SARS-CoV-specific sIgA may also provide a similar kind of protection against SARS-CoV invasion at mucosal sites in the absence of classical neutralizing activities. If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.\\nThe adjuvanticity of PIKA may be mostly derived from its main component Poly(I:C). However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] . Takeshi [11] .\\nFor development and application of an adjuvant for human use, the priority is its safety. CT is the most potent known mucosal adjuvant, but it has adverse side effects, such as nasal discharge in humans. Here we determined the mucosal adjuvanticity of a new adjuvant, PIKA, which is a derivative of Poly(I:C).\\nPoly(I:C) itself is toxic to human and can be rapidly hydrolyzed despite its strong adjuvanticity [6] . PIKA is an improved adjuvant which was formulated as a [26] . All together, PIKA is well formulated as a stable and safe adjuvant.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of PIKA as an adjuvant can significantly raise the humoral immune response with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV in serum and mucosal sites. Therefore, PIKA is a good adjuvant candidate and can be also used as mucosal vaccine.\",\n          \"Abstract Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review. Virus capture/purification/concentration is critical in a number of biopharmaceutical and clinical applications. Validation of virus clearance is essential in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, in particular blood products (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; de Mendoza et al. 2012; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Shukla et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, large-scale, efficient purification schemes of viruses/ virus-like particles are required for the production of prophylactic vaccines and gene therapy vectors (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2006 Segura et al. , 2011 Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Virus inactivation technologies are commonly used to fulfil viral safety. They include physical (e.g., heat application, ultraviolet-and gamma irradiation) and chemical methods (e.g., solvent/detergent treatments) or their combination (e.g., exposure to photosensitizer plus UV light) (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Klein and Bryant 2009; Pelletier et al. 2006; Prowse 2013; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Solheim 2008) . Common methods for virus capture include filtration (Charcosset 2006; Grein et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) and chromatography in column or membrane configurations (Charcosset 2006; Gottschalk 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2013; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Segura et al. 2011 ). Viral filtration is usually the final purification step in the downstream processing of biopharmaceutical products, e.g., monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 1) , following one or more chromatography ''polishing'' steps that contribute to the overall virus removal efficiency of the process before concentration of the purified product. Filtration technologies are also extensively used for the capture and concentration of waterborne viral pathogens (Gibson 2014 ) from drinking, environmental, recreational or waste water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In addition, particulate air filters are used in personal respiratory protective equipment (i.e., face masks and respirators) Cohen and Birkner 2012; Rengasamy et al. 2004) to ensure shortrange protection of wearers against airborne pathogens-which include a number of viruses (Tang et al. 2006 )-and in air purifiers/cleaners to limit longrange aerosol transmission of infection in healthcare settings (Hyttinen et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2006) .\\nCellulosic membrane microfilters have been used routinely for ages in laboratories to perform the socalled ''sterile filtration'' (cold sterilization), i.e., the absolute removal of bacteria, yeasts and molds but not viruses (Walsh and Denyer 2012) from heat-sensitive liquid media. However, many virus filtration devices currently implemented are made from cellulose and its derivatives. Some eighty years ago, Gradocol, graded collodion (cellulose nitrate) membrane filters (Elford 1931; Bauer and Hughes 1934) have been extensively used in ultrafiltration to estimate the size of several medically important viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease (Galloway and Elford 1931) , vaccinia (Elford and Andrewes 1932) , herpes (Elford et al. 1933) , poliomyelitis (Elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza (Elford et al. 1936 ) (see also Ferry (1936) for an exhaustive review). Later on, commercial mixed cellulose ester filters with very low pore size, namely VF (virus fine), VM (virus medium) and VC (virus coarse) grade filters produced by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA-a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), have also been applied to virus ultrafiltration for grouping by size assessment (Hsiung 1965). As part of a series of papers surveying the antiviral applications of polysaccharide-based materials, the present review focuses on viral filtration using cellulosic filter media-most of which are commercially available products that have been extensively tested over the past twenty years for the removal/concentration/purification of viral particles from liquid samples, i.e., biopharmaceutical (namely blood products) and environmental (raw or treated) water samples. The application of cellulose-based filters in individual respiratory protective devices protecting the wearer against airborne viral pathogens is also detailed. Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for viral clearance or recovery/purification of viruses or virus-like particles will be presented elsewhere.\\nIn the processing of biological products, virus removal from the product stream while providing maximum product recovery is a critical task. It is more particularly difficult to eliminate small viral particles such as parvoviruses, which may contaminate blood products and mammalian cell cultures used in the production of recombinant proteins (Charcosset 2006) . Viral filters developed to answer this challenge are typically membrane (screen) filters ensuring a size-based rejection of viral particles via a sieving mechanism. Given the size of viruses, ranging roughly from 20 (Parvoviridae) to 400 nm (Poxviridae) (Segura et al. 2011) , viral filtration stands between microfiltration and ultrafiltration among pressure-driven filtration processes (Fig. 2) , though it is frequently but incorrectly (van Reis and Zydney 2007) classified as nanofiltration (Burnouf et al. 2005 ).\\n2.1 Regenerated cellulose hollow fiber (HF) membrane filters\\nCommon virus filtration membranes are made from poly(ethersulfone) (PES), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and regenerated cellulose (Burnouf and Radosevich 2003; Carter and Lutz 2002; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) . Among the latter, the commercial Planova TM filters (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) have been widely used to clear viruses from biologically produced pharmaceuticals, in particular blood products. Planova filters are composed of cuprammonium regenerated cellulose HF (Bemberg TM cupro fibers), prepared from cellulose cuprammonium spinning solution via microphase separation under precise spinning conditions (Tsurumi et al. 1990b, c) . The wall of each HF has a threedimensional web structure of pores consisting of large, bulky void pores interconnected by fine capillaries (Tsurumi et al. 1990a, b, c) (Fig. 3 ). During filtration, as the feed solution containing the product of interest is circulated through the HF bore, viruses accumulate in the large, bulky void pores of the fiber network while the product solution passes through the capillary pores. Since the HF wall is several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 4) , viruses are captured gradually inside the porous structure that can be considered multi-layered (100-200 layers) (Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006) . Hence, Planova filters behave like ''membrane depth filters'' (Walsh and Denyer 2012) operating on the basis of size exclusion. They offer a choice of 4 nominal mean pore sizes, namely 15 nm (15N), 19 nm (20N), 35 nm (35N) and 72 nm (75N)-the large pore 75N model being essentially used as a prefilter to remove impurities or aggregates prior to final virus filtration-and can be operated in normal (dead-end/flow through) or tangential flow (cross flow) filtration mode (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Planova filters have emerged to answer a publichealth problem of worldwide magnitude, i.e., blood contamination by HIV (Hamamoto et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1989 ) and hepatitis viruses (Yuasa et al. 1991; Sekiguchi et al. 1989 Sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . Table 1 gives examples of viral clearance studies assessing the capacity of Planova filters to remove viruses from blood products. In these viral clearance assays, product streams resulting from successive, scaleddown purification steps representative of the manufacturing process of the product (Kundu and Reindel 2007) , were artificially contaminated (''spiked'') with model viruses of different sizes (Table 2 ) (at much higher concentrations than what might be commonly found in the product intermediate) before being submitted to filtration. The virus removal efficiency of the filtration step was expressed as LRV (log reduction value, i.e., log ratio of the viral load in the spiked product feed stream to that recovered in the product filtrate), which implies that residual virus infectivity can never be reduced to zero but may be greatly reduced mathematically (ICH 1999) . Minimum LRV values were most frequently given. They were estimated when no viruses could be detected in filtered samples taking into account the detection limit of the assay (viral titer estimated as 1 infectious unit per sample volume). From the measured LRVs, the filtration operation is usually classified as effective (LRV [ 4), moderately effective (1 \\\\ LRV \\\\ 4) or Makino et al. (1994) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) ineffective (LRV \\\\ 1) (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Since filtration complements other viral clearance methods in the downstream processing of biotherapeutics (Brorson 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2007) , several studies quoted in Table 1 also report LRVs for common virus reduction steps such as inactivation by pasteurization (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007) or solvent/detergent treatment (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) , and chromatographic capture (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012) . Virus removal during the plasma fractionation process (Bryant and Klein 2007) leading from the crude plasma pool to the product (immunoglobulin here) stream has also been quantified (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) . Overall virus reduction factors obtained by addition of successive LRVs are given in these works, as illustrated by Table 3. In the virus spiking studies quoted in Table 1 , the actual viral filtration step was preceded by prefiltration to eliminate viral and/or protein aggregates that might be present in the spiked product solution. The presence of aggregated viruses may lead to overestimation of size exclusion effectiveness while contributing with protein aggregates to the fouling of viral filters, which reduces the membrane hydraulic permeability and may affect virus retention (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Pre-filtration was performed on the spikevirus stock suspension (Caballero et al. 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2010 ) on the product intermediate before virus inoculation (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012) , and/or on the virus Furuya et al. (2006) and Terpstra et al. (2006) CPV Canine parvovirus B19 V Gr\\u00f6ner ( and Terpstra et al. (2006 Terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spiked material (Chtourou et al. 2007; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006 Terpstra et al. , 2007 . For pre-filtration of the virus preparation, micro filters with a pore size adapted to the spike virus size, i.e., slightly lower than the virus size, were used to remove cell aggregates but not single viral particles-usual pore sizes ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 lm. Micro filters with 0.1-0.2 lm pore size (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007; , but also 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012 ) and 35N (Chtourou et al. 2007) . Planova viral filters were used to pre-filtrate the spiked product solution. In the latter work, the association in series of 35N and 15N filters led to efficient removal of small viruses such as PPV (Chtourou et al. 2007 ). This was not the case when 35N was used as the main viral filter after pre-filtration with 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) , which confirms previous date showing that the 35 nm pore size was too large to retain the smallest viral particles (Furuya et al. 2006; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006 ). Both 20N (Caballero et al. 2014; Furuya et al. 2006; Gr\\u00f6ner 2014) and 15N (Caballero et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2010; Terpstra et al. 2007; Planova filters and their combination (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012 ) showed effective virus removal over a wide range of viral particle sizes (Table 1) . As a general rule, the removal efficiency of the filters increased with the ratio of pore size to virus size, as illustrated by Gr\\u00f6ner (2014) and Terpstra et al. (2007) . This was also demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2010) by filtrating poliovirus type 1 (a picorvanirus) through Planova filters manufactured with different pore sizes, ranging between 15 (LRV = 6.9) and 35 nm (LRV = 0.2). The two-filter combinations were globally more efficient than single filters at removing small viruses from spiked protein intermediates, though two 15N filters connected in parallel for tangential filtration (Koenderman et al. 2012) yielded LRVs quite similar to those obtained using 15N alone (Terpstra et al. 2006 ). Care should be taken when comparing vertically the data collected in Table 1 , however. In addition to the sizes of viral particles and filter pores, the results of such virus-spiking studies are dependent on a number of process parameters such as the filtration operating conditions (filtration mode, transmembrane pressure, volume per filter area, tempera-ture\\u2026), the characteristics of the product feed stream (pH, conductivity, nature and concentration of the product\\u2026), or else the purity level and concentration of the virus spike. Moreover, several studies include pre-filtration (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) or viral inactivation (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) in the calculation of LRVs. This variability in test conditions for filtration-based virus removal makes difficult any comparison between LRVs collected from multiple sources as in Table 1 , even though some results (Caballero et al. 2014; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2010 ) contradict its influence on filtration performance, underlining the robustness of the filtration process. Also, some variations in virus removal capacity may occur between commercial filter modules owing to their manufacture from different batches of HF, as illustrated by Roberts et al. (2010) for 15N filters.\\nLike membrane microfiltration, depth filtration is widely used as a clarification step in biopharmaceutical purification to ensure removal of cell debris, large aggregates and contaminants from the product stream prior to purification processes such as column/membrane chromatography and viral filtration/inactivation steps (Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Vicente et al. Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Commercially available depth filters currently employed in bioprocessing are composed of cellulose fibers with a porous inorganic filter aid and a resin binder, generally cationic. For instance, the Zeta Plus TM filter media (3 M Purification Inc.-formerly Cuno, Meriden, CT, USA) is composed of a cellulose fiber depth matrix containing silica-based filter-aid material and positively charged by chemical bounding of a cationic charge modifier (Ostreicher 1991) .\\nVarying retention ratings are available (0.1-1.0 lm). The triple layered A1HC filter media from EMD Millipore include two depth filtration layers (cellulose ? diatomaceous earth) of different grades and a 0.1 lm-pore-size microporous membrane pre-filter made of mixed cellulose esters (van Reis and Zydney 2007). Hence, these cellulosic depth filters rely on both size exclusion and electrostatic adsorptive binding to effect separation (Liu et al. 2010) . In viral spiking studies (Barnette et al. 2012; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2008) , they were found to retain viral particles whose surface is negatively charged over a wide range of pH as their isoelectric points (pI) range most frequently between 3.5 and 7.0, with a mean value of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 (Michen and Graule 2010) .\\nViruses are recognized as a major cause of waterrelated disease (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) . Enteric viruses, more particularly, which are associated primarily with gastrointestinal illness (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) , are implied in most waterborne viral outbreaks (Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011 ). All types of water, including waters used for drinking (surface or ground supplies), recreational waters (fresh, marine, and swimming pool), agricultural waters for irrigation (rivers and groundwater) and waste waters (sewage or industrial effluents), have been shown to be potential vehicles for virus transmission (Bosch et al. 2008) .\\nContamination is most frequently of fecal origin (Bosch et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2012) . Although viral levels may be high at the contamination source, e.g., concentrations ranging between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particles per gram of feces are referred to in the literature (Michen and Graule 2010) , viral concentrations as low as 1-10 viral particles per liter may be found in environmental water (Julian and Schwab 2012) . Since enteric viruses display high infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Julian and Schwab 2012) , such titers may constitute a health risk and should be detected for reliable surveillance of viral pathogens in water. As a consequence, efficient concentration methods are needed to capture viruses in large-volume water samples and release the retained viral material in concentrated form. Most common methods are based on filtration processes (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In particular, virus adsorptionelution (viradel) filter methods have been widely implemented since the 1970s (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Briefly, in a viradel method, viruses from aqueous samples are reversibly adsorbed to microporous filters and then eluted from the filters in a small liquid volume (APHA, AWWA and WEF 1998). Adsorbent filters carry electrical charges and virus retention occurs via electrostatic interaction rather than by size exclusion. In other words, viradel filters act as depth filters rather than sieves. Contrary to viral filters that retain viruses by a sieving mechanism to achieve complete viral clearance, their pore size lies in the microporous range, which allows the high flow filtration necessary for virus capture in large water samples. Positively or negatively charged filters can be used in a viradel procedure, among which those made of cellulosic materials have been dominant over the last few decades.\\nSince their pI is below the pH of natural water (i.e., around neutrality) ( \\nHuang et al. (2000) Table 5 continued Filter type a Water nature No.\\n[0 tested earlier for concentration of viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 4 ). More recent studies made use of Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilters, however (Table 5 ). In these works, pure (e.g., distilled), tap, environmental or sewage water samples were seeded with varying enteric viruses that are common waterborne pathogens, i.e., members of the families Picornaviridae (polioviruses, coxsakieviruses, teschoviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses), Caliciviridae (noroviruses, caliciviruses) and Reoviridae (rotaviruses) (Fong and Lipp 2005) , or bacteriophages (enterobacteria phages) that are considered as alternative indicators of fecal contamination and as index organisms for the presence of enteric viruses in waters (Goodridge and Steiner 2012). Naturally contaminated waters containing sufficient levels of indigenous viruses, more particularly bacteriophages, were also used in addition to spiking studies sensu stricto (Table 4) . Following sample filtration, viral particles adsorbed to the filter were eluted in concentrated form using a variety of eluting solutions, the most common eluent consisting of a slightly alkaline (pH 9.0-9.5) protein solution (i.e., beef extract), frequently buffered with glycine-NaOH or another amino acid solution (sometimes supplemented with salt to aid disruption of electrostatic interactions between viruses and filters (Shields and Farrah 1983) , a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea) or a surfactant (e.g., Tween 80) to affect virus-filter hydrophobic interactions . Eluted viruses were quantified-using plaque titer assays, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recovery efficiency of the filtration step by comparing to input titers. This efficiency depends on a number of process parameters including the filter type and filtration conditions (e.g., filtration rate and pressure), the elution buffer composition and eluting conditions, the nature, input titer and titration method of the tested virus-in addition to the water matrix characteristics that may affect virus quantification and filter performance (Borchardt et al. 2013) . Hence, Tables 4 and 5 display a wide range of recovery yields. In practical tests aimed at the detection of naturallyoccurring viruses in field, large-volume water samples, the filtration (adsorption-elution) step is usually a primary concentration step which is followed by a secondary one to reach the virus detection threshold, e.g., organic flocculation or PEG precipitation (Lewis and Metcalf 1988) . The recovery yield of such two-step concentration processes was evaluated in several studies using seeded or naturally contaminated water samples (Tables 4, 5) . As a general rule, the viral loss due to secondary concentration was balanced by a huge increase in concentration factor allowing virus detection in water concentrates from large-volume samples, as reported by Chang et al. (1981) and Raphael et al. (1985) for indigenous enteroviruses in wastewater and rotaviruses in sewage-polluted surface water, respectively. After determining the optimal elution conditions for 1 MDS disk-adsorbed noroviruses following filtration of spiked distilled water samples, Lee et al. (2011) (Table 5 ) applied the optimized procedure to the detection of noroviruses in environmental water. They combined adsorptive filtration using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich viruses from largevolume surface (200 l) and ground (500 l) water samples. This integrated two-step process led to high volume reduction factors, i.e., 10,000 and 25,000 for surface and ground water samples, respectively (200-5009 for filtration, 509 for organic flocculation), but its recovery efficiency was not evaluated by spiking studies. In the same way, beside spiking Woo et al. (2012) . a Ratio of the virus survival factor in the treated filter to that in the untreated filter, where the virus survival factor in a filter is the number of viruses recovered by elution from the filter divided by the number of viruses removed by the filtration process. b PF PP filter from commercial surgical mask (DuPont TM 01361N), CCF coarse pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 54, 22 lm pore size), FCF fine pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50, 2.7 lm pore size) studies like those detailed in Table 5 , 1 MDS filter cartridges have been widely applied to concentrate enteric viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 6) , ranging from large-volume samples of weakly contaminated water intended for drinking or drinking water production (Borchardt et al. 2003 (Borchardt et al. , 2004 Lee et al. 2014; Sedmak et al. 2005; Verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewater samples with high viral content-to assess the virus removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Kuo et al. 2010; Simmons et al. 2011) . In these tests of field water samples for enteric viruses, 1 MDS filtration was mainly combined with second-stage concentration by organic flocculation as detailed by Fout et al. (2001) in the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) manual of methods for virology. The elution of filter-adsorbed viral particles was mostly performed with an alkaline beef extract solution supplemented or not with glycine (buffers EB3 and EB1 in Table 5 ). The work by Verheyen et al. (2009) is an exception to these common procedures. To concentrate viruses in small-volume samples from drinking water sources, these authors used two filter cartridges in series with no additional concentration step and an alkaline powdered milk solution as elution buffer. They found that 20% (3/15) and 13% (32/247) of surface and ground (well) water sources, respectively, were contaminated with adenoviruses, with very few samples positive to rotavirus (0/15 surface water samples, 6/247 well water sources). Despite the differences in virus concentration methods, these results compare with those obtained by Xagoraraki et al. (2007) and Cheong et al. (2009) for adenovirus detection in surface (14/58 samples, 24%) and ground water (4/29 samples, 14%), respectively. They also agree with data reported by Borchardt et al. (2003) and Cheong et al. (2009) showing the low contamination level of ground water by rotavirus. It is worth noting here, however, that the number of positive samples reported in these viral analyses of water (and the others quoted in Table 6 ) is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection techniques used to assess the presence of viruses, i.e., nucleic acid-based amplification methods such as conventional PCR, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR/RT-PCR or integrated cell culture PCR (ICC/PCR) to determine virus infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Hamza et al. 2011, Mattison and Bidawid 2009; Watzinger et al. 2006) with different detection thresholds.\\nIt emerges from this glance at literature that cellulose-based electropositive filters are still commonly used for viral monitoring of water. These filters are expensive, however, and face competition with cheaper products, in particular nanoalumina fiber filters and glass wool filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . The former, NanoCeram TM filters manufactured by Argonide Corporation (Sanford, Fla., USA), are composed of nanosized (2 nm diameter), alumina-based {mainly boehmite, c-AlO(OH)} fibrilles dispersed in a microglass fiber matrix, resulting in an electropositive filter media with 2-3 lm average pore size Kaledin 2005, 2006) . The latter consist of commercial sodocalcic glass wool coated with mineral oil (type Bourre 725 QN/TECH Loose Wool, Isover Saint-Gobain, Courbevois, France), hand packed into columns or filter holders in the laboratory (Vilagin\\u00e8s et al. 1993) . These glass wool filters harbor electropositive sites while presenting hydrophobic surface characteristics. Efficient enrichment of (seeded or/ and) indigenous viruses from various water samples using NanoCeram (Gibbons et al. 2010; Ikner et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2012) , and glass wool (Deboosere et al. 2011; Lambertini et al. 2008; Wyn-Jones et al. 2011 ) filters has been reported in recent years (see also Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . Compared with 1 MDS filters (Table 5) , NanoCeram filters showed similar , slightly lower (McMinn 2013) or higher (Karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentration efficiency.\\nCommercially available under different pore sizes (0.025-8.0 lm), mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are negatively charged over a wide range of pH values, their overall negative charge increasing with pH (Kessick and Wagner 1978) . Microporous filters in the 0.1-0.45 lm pore size range have been used for ages in laboratory and industry for size-based filtration of bacterial particles and cell debris (surface filters). These and larger pore size filters have been shown to retain enteroviruses, however, despite the much smaller size of viral particles compared to the nominal mean diameter of filter pores (Cliver 1968 ). The presence of salts enhanced virus adsorption to cellulose ester membranes, this effect increasing with the cation valence (i.e., Al 3? [ Mg 2? [ Na ? ) (Wallis et al. 1972) . Acidification of the viral suspension also improved virus adsorption efficiency, even in the absence of exogenously added salts (Sobsey et al. 1973 ). These early results were later confirmed by Lukasik et al. (2000) , who investigated the influence of mono-, di-, and trivalent salts (NaCl, MgCl 2 , and AlCl 3 ) on the adsorption of poliovirus and enterobacteria phages to the MF-Millipore TM membrane filter type HA (0.45 lm pore size) and the electropositive 3M TM Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilter at neutral or acidic pH. At pH 7, salts promoted virus adsorption to HA filter while affecting adsorption to 1 MDS filter. At pH 3.5, more than 95% of the viruses tested adsorbed to HA filter with or without salt added to the viral suspension-the salts interfering again with viral adsorption to 1MDS filter. Furthermore, the addition of urea or Tween 80 to the salt solution affected virus adsorption to both filters at pH 3.5 and HA filter at pH 7. In agreement with previous studies by the same group (Haramoto et al. 2004 (Haramoto et al. , 2005 Lukasik et al. (2000) explained these results by the antichaotropic effect of salts that increased hydrophobic interactions between filters and viruses and was impaired by the chaotropic agent or the detergent. At neutral pH, charge screeening by salt addition reduced electrostatic attractive and repulsive forces between viruses and 1 MDS or HA filter, respectively. Cation-mediated cross-complexation between negative groups on virus and filter surfaces (Kessick and Wagner 1978) and, more particularly, strengthened hydrophobic virusfilter interactions contributed to improving the adsorption efficiency of HA filter. At acidic pH, viruses displayed a positive surface charge and their electrostatic interactions with HA filter switched from repulsive to attractive-and inversely for electropositive 1 MDS filter. The presence of salt probably affected these interactions but was balanced by the promoting effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions.\\nHence, most tests reported so far for virus concentration from water samples using cellulose ester filters (essentially HA filters) have been performed after addition of multivalent cations (mainly Mg 2? ) to the water samples with or without pH adjustment to an acidic level. According to Katayama et al. (2002) , the virus-loaded filters were rinsed with an acidic solution to eliminate remaining cations before elution with NaOH or other alkaline buffers. Haramoto et al. (2004 Haramoto et al. ( , 2005 Haramoto et al. ( , 2007a proposed a variation in the method that consisted in pre-conditioning the filter with Al 3? ions. Aluminum chloride was passed through the filter, making an electropositive ion coating, which avoided cation addition to the water sample. The recovery efficiency of both protocols has been evaluated by seeding water samples with enteric viruses and bacteriophages and quantifying eluted viruses (Table 7) . Similarly to spiking studies (Tables 4, 5) and viral analyses of field water samples (Table 6 ) with electropositive filters, the HA-based filtration/elution process was frequently associated with a secondary concentration step to increase virus concentration factors. Here, centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) using commercial Millipore (Centriprep \\u00d2 , Centricon \\u00d2 or Amicon \\u00d2 ) concentrators was the elective concentration method. These CU units contain a low adsorptive regenerated cellulose membrane (Ultracel \\u00d2 ) whose nominal molecular-weight cutoff ranges between 3 and 100 kDa-a MWCO value of 50 kDa being most frequently selected for secondary concentration of eluted viruses. They are routinely used in laboratories to purify and concentrate biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids from small-volume biological samples (e.g., 2-15 ml for the Centriprep filter unit). Tested or not for virus recovery by spiking experiments, the combined concentration procedures have been extended to the detection of enteric viruses in field water samples including tap (Haramoto et al. 2004 ), sea (Katayama et al. 2002) , river (surface) (Fong et al. 2010; Hamza et al. 2009; Haramoto et al. 2005 ) and waste (Fong et al. 2010; Katayama et al. 2008 ) water (Table 8) . Samples with different volumes were collected according to the water source, i.e., sample volumes increased as the expected contamination level decreased. For instance, Katayama et al. (2002) applied HA filtration, followed by acid rinse of the filter, viral elution with NaOH and secondary concentration of the eluate by CU, to concentrate naturally occurring viruses (noroviruses, enteroviruses and HAV-hepatitis A virus) in seawater samples. Based on the volume reduction factor (2-l sample/2 ml final concentrate, i.e., 1000) and the recovery yield of the two-step process (Table 7) , a virus concentration factor of 670 was reached. Only HAV virus was not detected in any sample tested. Later on, Katayama et al. (2008) followed the same protocol to concentrate enteric viruses in the raw influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Samples of 100-ml volume were collected and submitted to the two-step concentration process, yielding a volume reduction factor of c. 140. The four tested kinds of enteric viruses were detected in all 72 wastewater samples but one lacking norovirus GI (NoV GI). Using PEG precipitation as the secondary concentration step, Hamza et al. (2009) tested river water samples for contamination by enteric viruses and bacteriophages. A volume reduction factor of 5000 (10-l sample/2 ml final concentrate) and virus concentration factors ranging between 1000 (norovirus) and 5000 (adenovirus) (see Table 7 for recovery yields) were obtained. All 41 analyzed samples were found positive for enteric viruses. Human adenovirus and norovirus were detected in 97.5 and 32% of the samples, respectively. Haramoto et al. (2004) illustrated the ability of Al 3? -coated filters to concentrate viruses from large-volume freshwater samples without salt addition by detecting noroviruses in tap water from Tokyo University. Tap water samples (303-l average volume) underwent two successive filtration/elution steps using 293-mm and 47-mm diameter HA filters prior to concentration by CU (final volume: 0.9 ml), which ensured a volume reduction factor higher than 300,000. However, the virus recovery efficiency of the 3-step concentration process was not evaluated. Ten of the 98 tested samples were found positive for noroviruses. These results compare to those reported by Lee et al. (2011) ( Table 5 ) using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich noroviruses from large surface and ground water samples.\\nDespite these promising data, the two viradel methods based on electronegative filters (i.e., addition of MgCl 2 to water samples or filter coating with Al 3? ions before filtration) have been essentially implemented for viral analysis of waters containing high amounts of indigenous viruses, requiring limited sample volumes (Table 8 )-electropositive filter cartridges being more adapted to virus concentration from large volumes of weakly contaminated water (Table 6 ). Beside the above-mentioned work by Haramoto et al. (2004) , only two studies among those detailed in Table 8 describe virus detection in environmental water samples with low viral content, namely drinking water sources after chlorination or without treatment (Rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwater from artesian wells (Chironna et al. 2012) . Both studies used small-volume samples and CU as secondary concentration step, yielding a modest volume reduction factor of 1000. Very few from 202 artesian well water samples were found positive to the tested enteric viruses: none for HAV and enterovirus, 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus (Chironna et al. 2012) . A large proportion (50%) of samples from drinkingwater supplies was positive to adenovirus, however (Rigotto et al. 2010) . These data are compatible with viral analyses of groundwater and water intended for drinking performed using 1 MDS filtration as the first virus concentration step (Table 6 ). It should be noted, however, that the same remark applies to data collected in Table 8 as to those in Table 6 concerning the numbers of virus-positive samples, i.e., their dependence on the virus detection method. This can be illustrated by the two following examples. Using ICC-PCR (measuring infectious viruses), Katayama et al. (2002) detected enteroviruses in 4 of 6 seawater samples from bathing beach, but no sample was found positive by direct RT-PCR. De Paula et al. (2007) found 48/52 river water samples positive for HAV by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, but only 12/52 by nested RT-PCR.\\nAs attested by the large body of literature data quoted above, virus adsorption-elution methods using electropositive or electronegative filters are routinely applied to the primary concentration of waterborne viruses, each type of filter possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. Ultrafiltration is considered another filtration-based option to concentrate viruses from water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). It has been indicated earlier that CU with microconcentrators based on cellulose ultrafiltration discs is commonly used as a secondary concentration step following the viradel process. Hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), however, is considered a potential technique for primary concentration of viruses from large-volume water samples, yielding better virus recoveries than the viradel method performed with either electropositive or electronegative filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Commercial HFUF devices operated in cross-flow mode have been applied to the simultaneous concentration of biological particles, including viruses, spiked in tap (Polaczyk et al. 2008) or reclaimed (Liu et al. 2012) water samples, to virus recovery from seeded tap (Rhodes et al. 2011 ) and estuarine (Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ) water samples, and also, more rarely, to virus recovery from field water samples (Grassi et al. 2010; Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ). Most of these devices are dialyzers that contain synthetic HF made from polysulfone. Following the early work by Belfort et al. (1976) showing that polysulfone HF membranes were superior to cellulose acetate ones for virus concentration, virus concentration experiments using HFUF dialyzers equipped with HF manufactured from cellulose are scarce. An example is given by Liu et al. (2012) . They showed that the Exeltra Plus 210 cellulose triacetate HF dialyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) and the Optiflux \\u00d2 F200NR polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Walthamm, MA, USA) provided similar recovery efficiencies for MS2 and UX174 bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from spiked 10-l and 100-l samples of reclaimed water.\\nAn array of viral infections can be transmitted by the airborne route, in particular via aerosols (droplet nuclei) Tang et al. 2006; Tellier 2006; Verreault et al. 2008 ). Even though virus inactivation rates in the atmosphere are generally higher than those of bacterial and fungal contaminants, virus-containing aerosols can spread worldwide (Despr\\u00e9s et al. 2012) . The threat of viral outbreaks and pandemics such as those caused by SARS coronavirus (Yu et al. 2004 ) and highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus (Tellier 2006) , allied with the fear of bioterrorism using viruses (e.g., smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses) (Barras and Greub 2014) as biological weapons, has encouraged the search for efficient protection equipment against aerosolized virus-containing particles.\\nIndividual respiratory protective devices consist in respirators, i.e., air-filtering face masks designed to protect the wearer against inhalation of a hazardous atmosphere (here airborne infectious aerosols)-opposing to surgical masks designed to protect the environment from contaminants generated by the wearer's exhaled breath (i.e., prevention of surgical infections) . Currently, most ''filtering facepiece'' (FFP) respirators have a multilayer composite structure with a central filtering layer displaying electret properties (Gralton and McLaws 2010) . These electret filters (Thakur et al. 2013) are produced by imparting an electrostatic charge to a nonwoven fibrous mat composed of synthetic polymer fibers such as poly(propylene) (PP) (mainly), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(carbonate) fibers. Electrostatic charging of the filter media is commonly obtained by corona discharge, triboelectrification and electrostatic spinning (Tsai et al. 2002) . Electret filters collect particles through the combined action of mechanical and electrostatic forces (Podg\\u00f3rski 2010; Wang 2001 (CEN 2000) should retain respectively at least 95 and 94% of influent particles (NaCl particles are used as nonbiological surrogate particles) (Rengasamy et al. 2009 ). First worn by surgical teams a hundred years ago to prevent bacterial contamination of patient's open wounds, early surgical masks were constructed from layers of cellulose materials, more particularly cotton cellulose (gauze) (Haller and Colwell 1918) and derivatives (Arnold 1938 ) (see also Belkin 1997) . Much more recently, face masks made from cotton fabrics have been tested as alternative respiratory protective equipment against pandemic outbreaks such as influenza (Dato et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2013; Rengasamy et al. 2010) . Like respirators, current commercially available surgical face masks include several layers of non-woven fabrics with, frequently, a cellulose inner layer in contact with the wearer's face to improve wearer's comfort. However, the filtering layer, usually made of meltblown fibers (Ghosh 2014) , is devoid of electret properties. Since particulate filtration is only mechanical, i.e., less efficient than that of respirators, most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices, standard tests to evaluate their filtration efficacy being less stringent (Oberg and Brosseau 2008) .\\nWhile a number of studies have confirmed that surgical masks logically offer lower protection than respirators against aerosol particles, the effectiveness of both types of face masks at preventing viral respiratory infection, in particular influenza, is still a matter of controversy (Bin-Reza et al. 2012; Cowling et al. 2010; Gralton and McLaws 2010) . The improper facial fit of respirators Coia et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protection efficiency against infectious aerosols. It allows particulate flows outside the filtration area of the mask, resulting in face-seal leaks, i.e., the leakage of infectious particles around the edges of the mask (Grinshpun et al. 2009; Lei et al. 2013) . Mask seal leakage can be minimized by applying existing guidelines for correct donning and fit checking of respirators . Moreover, human face and head form models have been proposed as a tool for designing respirators with improved protection efficiency, simulating interactions between faces and facemasks and describing their fit (Golshahi et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2012) . The accumulation of viral particles at the surface and within the filtration media of respirators, where they can remain viable and infectious for extended periods of time (Coulliette et al. 2013; Sakaguchi et al. 2010) , is another significant problem with which respirator wearers are confronted in the prevention of viral transmission and spread. Incorrect mask handling by the wearer may lead to accidental self-inoculation, cross-contaminations affecting both other healthcare workers and patients, and contamination of fomites (Casanova et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the risk of virus reaerosolization from respirators during extended use, if limited, cannot be ruled out (Fisher et al. 2012) . Recommendations for respirator doffing do exist but have proven insufficient to prevent virus transfer from respirator to healthcare employees' hands and clothing (Casanova et al. 2008) . Adding antiviral properties to the filtration process may contribute to limit the risk of viral transmission by improper handling of used respirators. A number of virucidal facemasks have been developed and patented over the past 15 years (Tiliket et al. 2011) , some of which are commercially available. In the SpectraShield TM Plus respirator masks designed by Nexera Medical Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) (Haas 2008), for instance, two layers of filter media are sandwiched between (inner and outer) antimicrobial layers where a silver-copper zeolite (carrier) antimicrobial agent (Agion \\u00d2 antimicrobial, Sciessent LLC, Wakefield, Mass.) is embedded around the core of synthetic fibers (Fosshield \\u00d2 , Foss Manufacturing, Hampton, NH). The Biofriend TM Biomask TM FFP respirator, manufactured by Filligent Ltd. (Hong Kong) and distributed by Medline Industries, Inc. (Mundelein, Ill.) , is another four-layered device in which the melt-blown PP filtration layer is inserted between an inner layer of spunbond PP and two antiviral layers, namely a cellulose/polyester layer containing copper and zinc ions and an outer layer of spunbond PP treated with a low pH (citric acidacidified) hydrophilic plastic coating (Davison 2012; Stewart et al. 2014) . The outer layer absorbs infectious aerosol droplets and viruses are denaturated by exposure to citric acid. In the second layer, inactivation of viruses with damaged structures is completed by the virucidal effect of divalent metal cations. Contributing to the overall antiviral efficiency of the structure, the cellulosic component of this layer is a sulphated or sulfonated rayon fabric (Stewart et al. 2012 (Stewart et al. , 2014 to which a variety of viral human pathogens bind via the cationic sites of viral envelopes/capsids.\\nBeside the commercial Biomask TM respirator, various composite structures designed for filtrationinactivation of airborne microbial contaminants, where cellulosic materials play an active antimicrobial role, have been patented in recent years Bernard 2006; Nakamura and Nakamura 2011; Tsutsumi 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhong 2011) . Several of them are based on bacterial cellulose layers/coatings provided with an antimicrobial component, i.e., silver (Zhong 2011) or zeolite-supported silver (Nakamura and Nakamura 2011) nanoparticles, and chitosan (Zhang et al. 2012) . The respiratory protective mask described by Zhong (2011) comprises a three-layer bacterial cellulose membrane whose middle layer contains silver nanoparticles. The antimicrobial facemask invented by Nakamura and Nakamura (2011) includes two base cloth elements both of which are made of a woven textile (gauze), a nonwoven cellulose fabric (e.g., rayon), or a porous sheet (e.g., a 0.3-0.5 mm sliced sheet of urethane sponge). The first base cloth is filled with bacterial cellulose nanofibers that retain silver zeolite and a humectant (e.g., trehalose or 1,3-butylene glycol) in their network structure. Additional antimicrobial properties are provided to the mask by impregnating the second base cloth with a carboxylic acid (e.g., citric acid). Zhang et al. (2012) also used bacterial cellulose in a composite antimicrobial material suitable for respiratory protective masks. A nonwoven polymer fabric Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) 16:455-489 479 was coated with a film of bacterial cellulose mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improve the film-forming properties, mechanical strength and air permeability of the coating-and chitosan, a non-sulfated polysaccharide produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin that displays strong antibacterial potency (Kong et al. 2010; Rabea et al. 2003 ) and, to a lesser extent, antiviral activity (Rabea et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2012 ).\\nIn the antimicrobial air filtration device proposed by Bernard (2006) , cellulose derivatives-more particularly, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common pharmaceutical excipient for enteric coating of tablets and capsules with antiviral activity (Pirrone et al. 2011 )-were used as ''biocidal prophylactic compounds'' to provide the classical filter media (e.g., a nonwoven PP web, electrostatically charged or not) with antimicrobial properties. Cellulose derivatives could be incorporated as fibers or particles (micronized fibers) into the air filtration device either in a separate layer positioned before or after the filter media, or deposited onto the outer surface of the filter media relative to the air flow direction. To illustrate this invention, handsheets prepared from CAP fibers intermixed or not with CAP particles were successfully tested for virucidal efficacy by exposure to an aerosol challenge of enterobacteria phage \\u00d8X174.\\nBy exploiting the antimicrobial properties of dialdehyde polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose dialdehydes, Baney et al. (2012) proposed a new method for producing low-cost virucidal filters suitable for respiratory protective masks. The treatment of a standard cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50 filter paper) with sodium periodate improved its antiviral potency due to oxidation of some cellulose to dialdehyde cellulose inside the filter. Challenged with aerosols of MS2 enterobacteria phage at high relative humidity (90% at 23\\u00b0C), the treated filter showed higher filtration efficiency than a control, untreated one, i.e., better removal of viable viral particles (Plaque Forming Units) joined to a lower resistance to air flow (pressure drop)-due to increased pore size distribution (Woo et al. 2011) . Higher inactivation of MS2 virus by the treated filter was also highlighted, confirming an improvement of its disinfection capability (Woo et al. 2011 ). However, the filtration and inactivation of airborne viruses were less effective at lower moisture content of the filter, i.e., at air humidity levels commonly encountered in hospital settings, in particular operating rooms (Balaras et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, the inhalation resistance of the treated filter remained too high for application to respiratory protective masks. The same pros and cons apply to cellulose paper filters treated by immersion into aqueous suspensions of dialdehyde starch (DAS) (Woo et al. 2012) . While this treatment did not affect the removal efficiency of viable MS2 viruses from aerosols at high relative humidity, virus survival on the treated filters was reduced (Fig. 5 ) and the pressure drop decreased as DAS concentration increased. The drop in air flow resistance remained insufficient for practical application to respirators. DAS treatment of a PP filter from a commercial FFP mask did not modify the filtration parameters (virus removal efficiency and pressure drop) of the filter but significantly improved its biocidal efficacy (Fig. 5 )-an opening of this treatment towards the development of virucidal facemasks. Another example of cellulose filter material treated with cellulose derivatives to yield antiviral properties is given by Tsurumi (Tsutsumi 2009 ). This inventor devised a low-cost virucidal mask filter made of a standard cellulose nonwoven fabric impregnated with water extracts of sulfonated or aminated styrenegraft cellulose. To reinforce the water retention properties of the filter media, a superabsorbent resin such as poly(acrylic acid) was added to the graft cellulose extract before impregnation of the fabric or incorporated into a separate layer covering the impregnated fabric. Low (hydrogen ions from sulfonic acid groups) or high (hydroxyl ions generated by aminated groups) pH conditions inside the hydrated material were claimed to make it virucidal against influenza A virus and caliciviruses. The patent gives no illustration of such antiviral properties, however.\\nStudies published by Tiliket et al. (2011) and Catel-Ferreira et al. (2015) present another type of cellulosebased material for airborne virus filtration in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulose material, i.e., commercial Kimwipes \\u00d2 (KW) wipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., Dallas, Tex.), was chemically modified by coating with a synthetic polymer, i.e., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Tiliket et al. 2011) or grafting of an antiviral agent, i.e., catechin (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) . The filtration efficiency of the modified filter media was first tested on aerosolized T4D viruses (Enterobacteria phage T4, Doermann's strain T4D). Then the treated filter was inserted inside a commercial medical mask in place of its cellulosic layer (Kolmi M24001 mask, Kolmi-Hopen, Saint-Barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'Anjou, France), and the reconstructed mask was challenged with TD4 aerosols to evaluate its virus removal efficiency. Both treatments significantly improved the virus capture factor (ratio of upstream to downstream PFU contents) of KW cellulose wipes and of reconstructed commercial masks compared to original masks and to masks reconstructed with untreated wipes. In these studies, the breathability of reconstructed masks was not quantified, nor was the virus survivability on the modified filter media. However, additional filtration experiments using aerosols of influenza A virus (low pathogenic H5N2 strain) showed that challenged viral particles accumulated in PEI functionalized KW layers with no loss in number and infectivity (Tiliket et al. 2011) . Thus these modified masks showed no virucidal effect, the PEImodified layers behaving like an electret media owing to the polycationic character of PEI. On the other hand, since catechin and catechin-grafted wipes showed antiviral activity against T4D viruses in liquid media (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) , it may be assumed that part of viruses accumulated in excess in the treated wipes were inactivated by the polyphenol agent, i.e., the reconstructed masks were actually virucidal.\\nDespite these few examples, the use of cellulosic media in filtration devices aimed at the capture of airborne viral particles remains now very limited compared to filtration of virus-contaminated liquid samples. While patented, several cellulose-based, virucidal filter media designed for insertion in air filtering face masks have not been commercially developed yet.\\nBesides the wearing of personal respiratory protective equipment, another aspect of the fight against airborne infections lies in the decontamination of indoor air in healthcare facilities, and, more generally, of air processed through heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the built environment. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are the primary technology used for particulate removal in these collective protection devices-allied with UV irradiation, ozonation or air ionization to yield indoor air decontamination (Bolashikov and Melikov 2009; Jacob et al. 2013 )-and may be complemented with a photytocatalyst such as TiO 2 to improve the inactivation of accumulated microorganisms Pigeot-Remy et al. 2014 ). Since HEPA filters are essentially made of glass fibers, they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retentive properties will not be detailed further.\\nMost frequently associated with other virus reduction (virus clearance of biopharmaceuticals) or concentration (viral analysis of water) steps, size-exclusion and/ or adsorptive (charge mediated) filtration is an essential tool to fight against viral contaminants in aqueous media. Owing to inherent properties of cellulose, including mechanical strength and hydrophilicity (that opposes protein adsorption and biofouling), allied with widespread availability and biocompatibility, cellulose-based materials are still widely present in viral filters. Developed commercially over the past thirty years, several cellulosic filter media have been and continue to be used for both routine analyses in laboratories and academic research studies aimed at improving the filtration performance, generating a wealth of data quantifying the efficiency of virus removal or recovery/concentration from biologic or water samples, respectively.\\nAs concerns biopharmaceutical compounds, these data arise from validation studies of the filtration step performed by spiking intermediate biologic solutions (mostly blood proteins) from multistage purification processes with known titers of viral particles. Regenerated cellulose HF Planova filters N15-N35, operated in the dead-end mode as a single filter or two units in series, were shown to provide LRV values ranging between 4 and 7, on the average. Increasingly tested since their launching in 1989, these cellulosic filters compete with filter media made of synthetic polymers such as PVDF (e.g., Viresolve \\u00d2 NFP-Normal Flow Parvovirus-from EMD Millipore; Ultipor \\u00d2 VF Grade DV20/DV50 from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) or PES (e.g., Millipore Viresolve \\u00d2 Pro; Virosart \\u00d2 HS/HC/CPV from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). The hydrophilic nature of cellulose fibers is a definite advantage of Planova filters over others for virus removal from protein solutions, minimizing flux decline due to proteindominated filter plugging (cake formation) at constant pressure (normal-flow) filtration (Rathore et al. 2014 ). However, they are usually operated at lower flow rate than filters made of synthetic polymers whose operating pressure is higher. Hydrophilic modified PVDF membrane filters designed for virus removal from high-concentration protein solutions at high flow rate are being developed by several manufacturers, including Asahi-Kasei (i.e., Planova TM BioEX filters, launched in 2009).\\nMany studies have also been reported to assess the virus concentration efficiency of the viradel method using spiked water samples, prior to the detection of waterborne viral contaminants in field water samples. In this method, cellulosic filters, whether positively or negatively charged, are used for adsorptive capture of viruses before virus recovery by elution with a lowvolume eluent. Electropositive filters are more particularly suitable for virus capture in low-contaminated, high-volume water samples, e.g., samples of groundwater or source water for drinking water production ( Table 6) . Though routinely used, these filters are expensive and face competition with nanoalumina fiber filters (e.g., the patented Ahlstrom Disruptor \\u00d2 electroadsorptive filter) (Levi 2011 ) and glass wool filters, which are cheaper. On the other hand, efficient virus adsorption by electronegative filters-the standard, cost-effective mixed cellulose ester membrane microfilters-requires impractical sample pre-treatment: their use is limited to viral analysis of highlycontaminated waters, for which small-volume samples are sufficient (Table 8) .\\nCellulose nanomaterials may represent a promising perspective for cellulosic materials in their application to viral filtration of liquid samples, yielding filtration membranes with higher mechanical strength, water permeability, surface hydrophilicicy and resistance to biofouling (Carpenter et al. 2015) . Ma et al. (2011) have presented a composite membrane consisting of an electrospun poly(acrylonitrile) nanofibrous scaffold deposited on a non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) support. This two-layered membrane was coated by a layer of cellulose nanofibers and tested for retention of MS-2 phages. At acidic pH, phage particles were adsorbed by the negatively charged cellulose nanofiber coating, yielding a LRV value [3.7. Later on, the same nanofibrous composite membrane was doped with cellulose nanofibers functionalized by grafting with poly(vinylamine) . MS-2 phages were adsorbed at neutral pH onto positively charged amino-modified nanofibers, with a LRV value of 4. Metreveli et al. (2014) and Asper et al. (2015) have presented a size-exclusionbased filter paper made of pure cellulose nanofibers for removal of swine influenza A and murine leukemia viruses, respectively. These non-woven materials could be tailored to ensure efficient virus retention (Gustafsson and Mihranyan 2016a). Self assembled into nanosheets to yield ''mille feuille'' structures, they showed efficient removal of parvoviruses (Gustafsson et al. 2016b) : maybe a new filtration media for viral clearance?\\nA number of air filtration devices designed for individual protection against airborne viruses also include cellulosic materials. While published data on the filtration performance of cellulosic media for removal of viruses from air are scarce, industrial research is more apparent, in particular in Asian countries (China, Japan) where airborne pollution is a matter of great concern-the main objective being to add virucidal properties to the filtration media so as to inactivate accumulated viral particles. Therefore, some innovative media have been patented over the past few years with, however, no commercial development to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1405,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Radoshevich, Lilliana.

METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.\",\n          \"250 words VIRAL ETIOLOGY AND OUTCOME OF SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS AMONG CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO THE PICU ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the viral etiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their clinical significance and prognosis among critically ill children.\\nPatients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded.\\nMain variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded.\\nResults: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV. Additionally, they were found to have a high Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, Predicted Death Rate and increased need for inotropic support at admission.\\nOur study showed critically ill children with LRTI without known risk factors to have high mortality when aged < 12 months, in the presence of multiple agents and when certain complications (ARDS, hepatitis) and X-ray findings were identified.\\nETIOLOG\\u00cdA V\\u00cdRICA Y DESENLACE DE INFECCIONES DE LAS V\\u00cdAS RESPIRATORIAS BAJAS ENTRE NI\\u00d1OS CR\\u00cdTICAMENTE ENFERMOS INGRESADOS EN UCIP\\nObjetivo: determinar la etiolog\\u00eda v\\u00edrica de las infecciones graves de las v\\u00edas respiratorias bajas (IGVRB), su importancia cl\\u00ednica y su pron\\u00f3stico en ni\\u00f1os cr\\u00edticamente enfermos.\\n\\u00c1mbito: unidad de cuidados intensivos pedi\\u00e1tricos (UCIP) del Hospital Universitario y de Investigaci\\u00f3n Goztepe, Universidad Medeniyet de Estambul (Turqu\\u00eda).\\nPacientes y participantes: se evalu\\u00f3 a un total de 115 pacientes ingresados en la UCIP para su posible inclusi\\u00f3n en el estudio.

Summary This study applied molecular-based method to investigate the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in 59 commercial pig farms in South Korea. The results of RT-PCR screening on a relatively large collection of faeces samples (n = 681) from January 2013 to March 2015 did not reveal the presence of PDCoV until the end of 2014. However, on March 2015, PDCoV-positive samples (SL2, SL5) were detected from SL swine farm in Gyeongbuk province. The phylogenetic trees based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related to the US PDCoV strains rather than those in China. Thought Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) grouped within US PDCoV cluster, the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes suggested that they are different.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 Background On December 31 st , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] .\\nOver the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3] . In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum readiness level [4] . As of April 24, France is the 6 th most severely affected country in the world (in terms of absolute numbers), with approximately 120,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5] . With about 6,000 deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].\\nThe first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 th [7] : in a series of 18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7] [8] [9] [10] .\\nCancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of severe outcome [8, 10] . These retrospective reports, of limited size and restricted to patients hospitalized in Chinese hospitals, may not be fully transposable to Western healthcare systems, as suggested by a preliminary report on New Yorkers admitted to ICU [11] .\\nOur study reports the COVID-19 features and outcomes experienced by inpatients and outpatients actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH) in the Paris area, France.\\nAll rights reserved.

Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19\\nwere hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external intensive care units.\\nSurgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (\\\"plan blanc\\\") required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by learned societies [12] , included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.\\nMedical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national guidelines for breast cancer patients [12] : ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to 75 mg/m 2 . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and everolimus.

Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were systematically reduced by one half and were discontinued whenever possible.\\nRadiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was hypofractionated whenever possible [12, 13] Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the French society of palliative care [14] .\\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms, but subsequently became available to all cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the viral RdRp gene. All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [16, 17] , the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, focal consolidation and linear consolidation. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans. Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [19]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (0: no involvement; 1: \\u226410% of lung volumes; 2: 11-25%; 3: \\u226526% involvement).

Starting from March 13th, 2020, all proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered, as the registry also allowed for clinical follow-up phone calls scheduled at days 8, 14 and 28. More frequent and/or longer follow-up was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also registered and prospectively followed. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 th , 2020. This report was written according to the STROBE checklist.\\nThree populations were considered: patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR (positive RNA test); patients who had a positive RNA test or for whom RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but suggestive radiologic findings (COVID-19 patients); patients with symptoms only. Main outcome of patients were defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor analysis was performed. As a sensitivity analysis, prognostic factor analysis of death only was performed. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.\\nFrom March 13 th , 2020 to April 25 th , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in Figure 1A . RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41 patients) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings (N=18 patients).

Figure 1B .\\nBreast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1 . Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients (17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension (36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).\\nAbout two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing anti-cancer treatments were representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).\\nClinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 2 . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the 59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm 3 ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. The most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities, observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. Figure 2 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease: no significant association was observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19 lung disease.\\nAll patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home.

The flow of COVID-19 patients during the the course disease is shown in Figure 3 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24 th , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nNoteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).\\nFurther details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Supplementary Table 1 .\\nAn exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19 population showed that only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). They remained as prognostic factors in the RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast cancer patients.\\nWhile 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [20]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients, as a whole, are not at high risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This apparent low incidence could possibly be attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been All rights reserved.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.\\nIn terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the subgroup with positive RNA tests. As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.\\nWhile lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus of attention to define patients at high risk.

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.\\nMucosal immunity plays an important role in prevention of invasion by pathogens, which could be induced via systemic or mucosal immunization.\\nHowever, both immunization protocols require an effective adjuvant to produce better immune responses.\\nMucosally delivered antigen in the absence of an adjuvant usually induces either a low or undetectable antigen-specific immune response or results in immune tolerance [7, 43] . At present, a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States or elsewhere. Examples include oral vaccines, which mostly comprise live attenuated antigens, against Poliovirus [29] , V. cholerae, Salmonella typhi [22] , and Rotavirus [14] , and a nasal vaccine against influenza virus [3] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective mucosal adjuvant is a high priority in the development of efficient mucosal vaccine.\\nA synthetic dsRNA, termed Poly(I:C), has been found be able to boost immune responses since the 1960s [10, 45] . Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).\\nPIKA is a particular derivative of Poly (I:C) comprising kanamycin and calcium chloride [25] specific IgG and IFN-\\u03b3 responses in mice [33] . Most recent studies also showed that PIKA can provide broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses and coadministration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic H5N1 subunit vaccine can lead to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvements of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice [18, 19] .\\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of this \\nProduct [24] was inactivated with formaldehyde. PIKA is an improved adjuvant formulation comprising a derivative of Poly(I:C), kanamycin and calcium chloride [23, 33] , which was manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices by NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore.\\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Hubei CDC and maintained in SPF environment throughout the experiment. The mice were immunized through either an intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV or 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV plus the indicated dose of PIKA. Mice immunized with PBS served as a negative control. The protocol for intranasal immunization required the mice to be anesthetized slightly with sodium pentobarbital and held inverted with nose up until droplets of vaccine that were applied to both external nares were completely inhaled [13] . All intranasally immunizing reagents were suspended with PBS. Individual mice received 10 \\u00b5L of inoculants for five times with a 30 min resting interval between inoculations (total volume, 50 \\u00b5L). For intraperitoneal immunization, vaccine compositions were adjusted with PBS to a consistent 200 \\u00b5L dose. Each mouse received three immunizations with a 2-week interval between each immunization.\\nAll samples were collected two weeks after the final immunization as previously described [9] . Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital plexus puncture. Saliva was obtained after intraperitoneal injection with 20\\u00b5g of carbamylcholine chloride. The vaginal tract of individual mice was washed with 30\\u00b5L PBS for three times, with a total volume of 90\\u00b5L. After removing feces, small intestine tissues were weighed, cut into small pieces, mixed with PBS (100 mg of small intestine in 200\\u00b5L of PBS), and rocked at 4\\u2103 for 5 h. For collection of lung washing fluid, the trachea was exposed surgically and the oral portion of trachea was clamped, a 1-mL syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle was inserted into the trachea, 200\\u00b5L of PBS was injected into the peripheral airways, and five cycles of aspiration and injection were repeated [36] .

A parenterally administered viruslike particle even elicited 90% to 100% efficacy against infection and pre-invasive disease in previously uninfected individuals [15] .\\nFor determining correlation between neutralizing activity and antibody in serum and mucosal secretion, both IgG and IgA responses in serum and in mucosal secretion were tested. In our study, neutralizing activity was detected in lung samples from three groups of mice, in which only specific IgG but not IgA could be detected (Fig. 2-4) . Antibody analysis also indicated that it was specific IgG but not specific IgA response at mucosal sites that was correlated with neutralizing activity. It is very possible that mucosal IgG could also play an important role in contributing to the neutralizing activity at mucosal sites. It has been propose [41] , serum IgG induced in parenteral immunization could find its way to the mucosae to exert protective effects. The relatively high concentrations of IgG seen at particular mucosal sites may reflect a combination of constitutive transcellular or paracellular transport from the systemic compartment and specific transport mechanism [41] .\\nTherefore, detection of IgG response in mucosal sites is also useful for evaluation of mucosal immune response and related neutralizing activity.\\nBecause SARS-CoV infection occurs at mucosal surfaces, such as lung, digestive surfaces and even vaginal surface [20, 21, 26, 38, 40] , the induction of a neutralizing activity which could block virus attachment and infection is more important in SARS-CoV prevention. Our study showed that PIKA was effective at inducing neutralizing activity at mucosal sites when co-administered by intraperitoneal and intranasal immunization (Fig. 2) . Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA. This may partially result from certain loss of vaccine antigen, dilution by mucosal secretion, capture by mucus gels, attack by proteases and nucleases, or exclusion by epithelial cells when delivered through mucosal routes [30] .\\nHowever, it should be noted that intranasal immunization could induce much higher specific IgA responses than intraperitoneal immunization. Many studies already demonstrated that mucosal sIgA can inhibit viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular virus neutralization, and transepithelial transport of immune complexes [17, 28, 44] . Even rotavirus VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies that lack neutralizing activity can protect mice against infection by] rotavirus via an intracellular neutralization mechanism [5] . SARS-CoV-specific sIgA may also provide a similar kind of protection against SARS-CoV invasion at mucosal sites in the absence of classical neutralizing activities. If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.\\nThe adjuvanticity of PIKA may be mostly derived from its main component Poly(I:C). However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] . Takeshi [11] .\\nFor development and application of an adjuvant for human use, the priority is its safety. CT is the most potent known mucosal adjuvant, but it has adverse side effects, such as nasal discharge in humans. Here we determined the mucosal adjuvanticity of a new adjuvant, PIKA, which is a derivative of Poly(I:C).\\nPoly(I:C) itself is toxic to human and can be rapidly hydrolyzed despite its strong adjuvanticity [6] . PIKA is an improved adjuvant which was formulated as a [26] . All together, PIKA is well formulated as a stable and safe adjuvant.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of PIKA as an adjuvant can significantly raise the humoral immune response with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV in serum and mucosal sites. Therefore, PIKA is a good adjuvant candidate and can be also used as mucosal vaccine.\",\n          \"Abstract Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review. Virus capture/purification/concentration is critical in a number of biopharmaceutical and clinical applications. Validation of virus clearance is essential in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, in particular blood products (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; de Mendoza et al. 2012; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Shukla et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, large-scale, efficient purification schemes of viruses/ virus-like particles are required for the production of prophylactic vaccines and gene therapy vectors (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2006 Segura et al. , 2011 Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Virus inactivation technologies are commonly used to fulfil viral safety. They include physical (e.g., heat application, ultraviolet-and gamma irradiation) and chemical methods (e.g., solvent/detergent treatments) or their combination (e.g., exposure to photosensitizer plus UV light) (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Klein and Bryant 2009; Pelletier et al. 2006; Prowse 2013; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Solheim 2008) . Common methods for virus capture include filtration (Charcosset 2006; Grein et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) and chromatography in column or membrane configurations (Charcosset 2006; Gottschalk 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2013; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Segura et al. 2011 ). Viral filtration is usually the final purification step in the downstream processing of biopharmaceutical products, e.g., monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 1) , following one or more chromatography ''polishing'' steps that contribute to the overall virus removal efficiency of the process before concentration of the purified product. Filtration technologies are also extensively used for the capture and concentration of waterborne viral pathogens (Gibson 2014 ) from drinking, environmental, recreational or waste water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In addition, particulate air filters are used in personal respiratory protective equipment (i.e., face masks and respirators) Cohen and Birkner 2012; Rengasamy et al. 2004) to ensure shortrange protection of wearers against airborne pathogens-which include a number of viruses (Tang et al. 2006 )-and in air purifiers/cleaners to limit longrange aerosol transmission of infection in healthcare settings (Hyttinen et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2006) .\\nCellulosic membrane microfilters have been used routinely for ages in laboratories to perform the socalled ''sterile filtration'' (cold sterilization), i.e., the absolute removal of bacteria, yeasts and molds but not viruses (Walsh and Denyer 2012) from heat-sensitive liquid media. However, many virus filtration devices currently implemented are made from cellulose and its derivatives. Some eighty years ago, Gradocol, graded collodion (cellulose nitrate) membrane filters (Elford 1931; Bauer and Hughes 1934) have been extensively used in ultrafiltration to estimate the size of several medically important viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease (Galloway and Elford 1931) , vaccinia (Elford and Andrewes 1932) , herpes (Elford et al. 1933) , poliomyelitis (Elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza (Elford et al. 1936 ) (see also Ferry (1936) for an exhaustive review). Later on, commercial mixed cellulose ester filters with very low pore size, namely VF (virus fine), VM (virus medium) and VC (virus coarse) grade filters produced by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA-a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), have also been applied to virus ultrafiltration for grouping by size assessment (Hsiung 1965). As part of a series of papers surveying the antiviral applications of polysaccharide-based materials, the present review focuses on viral filtration using cellulosic filter media-most of which are commercially available products that have been extensively tested over the past twenty years for the removal/concentration/purification of viral particles from liquid samples, i.e., biopharmaceutical (namely blood products) and environmental (raw or treated) water samples. The application of cellulose-based filters in individual respiratory protective devices protecting the wearer against airborne viral pathogens is also detailed. Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for viral clearance or recovery/purification of viruses or virus-like particles will be presented elsewhere.\\nIn the processing of biological products, virus removal from the product stream while providing maximum product recovery is a critical task. It is more particularly difficult to eliminate small viral particles such as parvoviruses, which may contaminate blood products and mammalian cell cultures used in the production of recombinant proteins (Charcosset 2006) . Viral filters developed to answer this challenge are typically membrane (screen) filters ensuring a size-based rejection of viral particles via a sieving mechanism. Given the size of viruses, ranging roughly from 20 (Parvoviridae) to 400 nm (Poxviridae) (Segura et al. 2011) , viral filtration stands between microfiltration and ultrafiltration among pressure-driven filtration processes (Fig. 2) , though it is frequently but incorrectly (van Reis and Zydney 2007) classified as nanofiltration (Burnouf et al. 2005 ).\\n2.1 Regenerated cellulose hollow fiber (HF) membrane filters\\nCommon virus filtration membranes are made from poly(ethersulfone) (PES), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and regenerated cellulose (Burnouf and Radosevich 2003; Carter and Lutz 2002; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) . Among the latter, the commercial Planova TM filters (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) have been widely used to clear viruses from biologically produced pharmaceuticals, in particular blood products. Planova filters are composed of cuprammonium regenerated cellulose HF (Bemberg TM cupro fibers), prepared from cellulose cuprammonium spinning solution via microphase separation under precise spinning conditions (Tsurumi et al. 1990b, c) . The wall of each HF has a threedimensional web structure of pores consisting of large, bulky void pores interconnected by fine capillaries (Tsurumi et al. 1990a, b, c) (Fig. 3 ). During filtration, as the feed solution containing the product of interest is circulated through the HF bore, viruses accumulate in the large, bulky void pores of the fiber network while the product solution passes through the capillary pores. Since the HF wall is several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 4) , viruses are captured gradually inside the porous structure that can be considered multi-layered (100-200 layers) (Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006) . Hence, Planova filters behave like ''membrane depth filters'' (Walsh and Denyer 2012) operating on the basis of size exclusion. They offer a choice of 4 nominal mean pore sizes, namely 15 nm (15N), 19 nm (20N), 35 nm (35N) and 72 nm (75N)-the large pore 75N model being essentially used as a prefilter to remove impurities or aggregates prior to final virus filtration-and can be operated in normal (dead-end/flow through) or tangential flow (cross flow) filtration mode (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Planova filters have emerged to answer a publichealth problem of worldwide magnitude, i.e., blood contamination by HIV (Hamamoto et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1989 ) and hepatitis viruses (Yuasa et al. 1991; Sekiguchi et al. 1989 Sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . Table 1 gives examples of viral clearance studies assessing the capacity of Planova filters to remove viruses from blood products. In these viral clearance assays, product streams resulting from successive, scaleddown purification steps representative of the manufacturing process of the product (Kundu and Reindel 2007) , were artificially contaminated (''spiked'') with model viruses of different sizes (Table 2 ) (at much higher concentrations than what might be commonly found in the product intermediate) before being submitted to filtration. The virus removal efficiency of the filtration step was expressed as LRV (log reduction value, i.e., log ratio of the viral load in the spiked product feed stream to that recovered in the product filtrate), which implies that residual virus infectivity can never be reduced to zero but may be greatly reduced mathematically (ICH 1999) . Minimum LRV values were most frequently given. They were estimated when no viruses could be detected in filtered samples taking into account the detection limit of the assay (viral titer estimated as 1 infectious unit per sample volume). From the measured LRVs, the filtration operation is usually classified as effective (LRV [ 4), moderately effective (1 \\\\ LRV \\\\ 4) or Makino et al. (1994) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) ineffective (LRV \\\\ 1) (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Since filtration complements other viral clearance methods in the downstream processing of biotherapeutics (Brorson 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2007) , several studies quoted in Table 1 also report LRVs for common virus reduction steps such as inactivation by pasteurization (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007) or solvent/detergent treatment (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) , and chromatographic capture (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012) . Virus removal during the plasma fractionation process (Bryant and Klein 2007) leading from the crude plasma pool to the product (immunoglobulin here) stream has also been quantified (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) . Overall virus reduction factors obtained by addition of successive LRVs are given in these works, as illustrated by Table 3. In the virus spiking studies quoted in Table 1 , the actual viral filtration step was preceded by prefiltration to eliminate viral and/or protein aggregates that might be present in the spiked product solution. The presence of aggregated viruses may lead to overestimation of size exclusion effectiveness while contributing with protein aggregates to the fouling of viral filters, which reduces the membrane hydraulic permeability and may affect virus retention (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Pre-filtration was performed on the spikevirus stock suspension (Caballero et al. 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2010 ) on the product intermediate before virus inoculation (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012) , and/or on the virus Furuya et al. (2006) and Terpstra et al. (2006) CPV Canine parvovirus B19 V Gr\\u00f6ner ( and Terpstra et al. (2006 Terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spiked material (Chtourou et al. 2007; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006 Terpstra et al. , 2007 . For pre-filtration of the virus preparation, micro filters with a pore size adapted to the spike virus size, i.e., slightly lower than the virus size, were used to remove cell aggregates but not single viral particles-usual pore sizes ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 lm. Micro filters with 0.1-0.2 lm pore size (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007; , but also 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012 ) and 35N (Chtourou et al. 2007) . Planova viral filters were used to pre-filtrate the spiked product solution. In the latter work, the association in series of 35N and 15N filters led to efficient removal of small viruses such as PPV (Chtourou et al. 2007 ). This was not the case when 35N was used as the main viral filter after pre-filtration with 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) , which confirms previous date showing that the 35 nm pore size was too large to retain the smallest viral particles (Furuya et al. 2006; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006 ). Both 20N (Caballero et al. 2014; Furuya et al. 2006; Gr\\u00f6ner 2014) and 15N (Caballero et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2010; Terpstra et al. 2007; Planova filters and their combination (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012 ) showed effective virus removal over a wide range of viral particle sizes (Table 1) . As a general rule, the removal efficiency of the filters increased with the ratio of pore size to virus size, as illustrated by Gr\\u00f6ner (2014) and Terpstra et al. (2007) . This was also demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2010) by filtrating poliovirus type 1 (a picorvanirus) through Planova filters manufactured with different pore sizes, ranging between 15 (LRV = 6.9) and 35 nm (LRV = 0.2). The two-filter combinations were globally more efficient than single filters at removing small viruses from spiked protein intermediates, though two 15N filters connected in parallel for tangential filtration (Koenderman et al. 2012) yielded LRVs quite similar to those obtained using 15N alone (Terpstra et al. 2006 ). Care should be taken when comparing vertically the data collected in Table 1 , however. In addition to the sizes of viral particles and filter pores, the results of such virus-spiking studies are dependent on a number of process parameters such as the filtration operating conditions (filtration mode, transmembrane pressure, volume per filter area, tempera-ture\\u2026), the characteristics of the product feed stream (pH, conductivity, nature and concentration of the product\\u2026), or else the purity level and concentration of the virus spike. Moreover, several studies include pre-filtration (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) or viral inactivation (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) in the calculation of LRVs. This variability in test conditions for filtration-based virus removal makes difficult any comparison between LRVs collected from multiple sources as in Table 1 , even though some results (Caballero et al. 2014; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2010 ) contradict its influence on filtration performance, underlining the robustness of the filtration process. Also, some variations in virus removal capacity may occur between commercial filter modules owing to their manufacture from different batches of HF, as illustrated by Roberts et al. (2010) for 15N filters.\\nLike membrane microfiltration, depth filtration is widely used as a clarification step in biopharmaceutical purification to ensure removal of cell debris, large aggregates and contaminants from the product stream prior to purification processes such as column/membrane chromatography and viral filtration/inactivation steps (Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Vicente et al. Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Commercially available depth filters currently employed in bioprocessing are composed of cellulose fibers with a porous inorganic filter aid and a resin binder, generally cationic. For instance, the Zeta Plus TM filter media (3 M Purification Inc.-formerly Cuno, Meriden, CT, USA) is composed of a cellulose fiber depth matrix containing silica-based filter-aid material and positively charged by chemical bounding of a cationic charge modifier (Ostreicher 1991) .\\nVarying retention ratings are available (0.1-1.0 lm). The triple layered A1HC filter media from EMD Millipore include two depth filtration layers (cellulose ? diatomaceous earth) of different grades and a 0.1 lm-pore-size microporous membrane pre-filter made of mixed cellulose esters (van Reis and Zydney 2007). Hence, these cellulosic depth filters rely on both size exclusion and electrostatic adsorptive binding to effect separation (Liu et al. 2010) . In viral spiking studies (Barnette et al. 2012; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2008) , they were found to retain viral particles whose surface is negatively charged over a wide range of pH as their isoelectric points (pI) range most frequently between 3.5 and 7.0, with a mean value of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 (Michen and Graule 2010) .\\nViruses are recognized as a major cause of waterrelated disease (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) . Enteric viruses, more particularly, which are associated primarily with gastrointestinal illness (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) , are implied in most waterborne viral outbreaks (Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011 ). All types of water, including waters used for drinking (surface or ground supplies), recreational waters (fresh, marine, and swimming pool), agricultural waters for irrigation (rivers and groundwater) and waste waters (sewage or industrial effluents), have been shown to be potential vehicles for virus transmission (Bosch et al. 2008) .\\nContamination is most frequently of fecal origin (Bosch et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2012) . Although viral levels may be high at the contamination source, e.g., concentrations ranging between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particles per gram of feces are referred to in the literature (Michen and Graule 2010) , viral concentrations as low as 1-10 viral particles per liter may be found in environmental water (Julian and Schwab 2012) . Since enteric viruses display high infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Julian and Schwab 2012) , such titers may constitute a health risk and should be detected for reliable surveillance of viral pathogens in water. As a consequence, efficient concentration methods are needed to capture viruses in large-volume water samples and release the retained viral material in concentrated form. Most common methods are based on filtration processes (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In particular, virus adsorptionelution (viradel) filter methods have been widely implemented since the 1970s (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Briefly, in a viradel method, viruses from aqueous samples are reversibly adsorbed to microporous filters and then eluted from the filters in a small liquid volume (APHA, AWWA and WEF 1998). Adsorbent filters carry electrical charges and virus retention occurs via electrostatic interaction rather than by size exclusion. In other words, viradel filters act as depth filters rather than sieves. Contrary to viral filters that retain viruses by a sieving mechanism to achieve complete viral clearance, their pore size lies in the microporous range, which allows the high flow filtration necessary for virus capture in large water samples. Positively or negatively charged filters can be used in a viradel procedure, among which those made of cellulosic materials have been dominant over the last few decades.\\nSince their pI is below the pH of natural water (i.e., around neutrality) ( \\nHuang et al. (2000) Table 5 continued Filter type a Water nature No.\\n[0 tested earlier for concentration of viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 4 ). More recent studies made use of Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilters, however (Table 5 ). In these works, pure (e.g., distilled), tap, environmental or sewage water samples were seeded with varying enteric viruses that are common waterborne pathogens, i.e., members of the families Picornaviridae (polioviruses, coxsakieviruses, teschoviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses), Caliciviridae (noroviruses, caliciviruses) and Reoviridae (rotaviruses) (Fong and Lipp 2005) , or bacteriophages (enterobacteria phages) that are considered as alternative indicators of fecal contamination and as index organisms for the presence of enteric viruses in waters (Goodridge and Steiner 2012). Naturally contaminated waters containing sufficient levels of indigenous viruses, more particularly bacteriophages, were also used in addition to spiking studies sensu stricto (Table 4) . Following sample filtration, viral particles adsorbed to the filter were eluted in concentrated form using a variety of eluting solutions, the most common eluent consisting of a slightly alkaline (pH 9.0-9.5) protein solution (i.e., beef extract), frequently buffered with glycine-NaOH or another amino acid solution (sometimes supplemented with salt to aid disruption of electrostatic interactions between viruses and filters (Shields and Farrah 1983) , a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea) or a surfactant (e.g., Tween 80) to affect virus-filter hydrophobic interactions . Eluted viruses were quantified-using plaque titer assays, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recovery efficiency of the filtration step by comparing to input titers. This efficiency depends on a number of process parameters including the filter type and filtration conditions (e.g., filtration rate and pressure), the elution buffer composition and eluting conditions, the nature, input titer and titration method of the tested virus-in addition to the water matrix characteristics that may affect virus quantification and filter performance (Borchardt et al. 2013) . Hence, Tables 4 and 5 display a wide range of recovery yields. In practical tests aimed at the detection of naturallyoccurring viruses in field, large-volume water samples, the filtration (adsorption-elution) step is usually a primary concentration step which is followed by a secondary one to reach the virus detection threshold, e.g., organic flocculation or PEG precipitation (Lewis and Metcalf 1988) . The recovery yield of such two-step concentration processes was evaluated in several studies using seeded or naturally contaminated water samples (Tables 4, 5) . As a general rule, the viral loss due to secondary concentration was balanced by a huge increase in concentration factor allowing virus detection in water concentrates from large-volume samples, as reported by Chang et al. (1981) and Raphael et al. (1985) for indigenous enteroviruses in wastewater and rotaviruses in sewage-polluted surface water, respectively. After determining the optimal elution conditions for 1 MDS disk-adsorbed noroviruses following filtration of spiked distilled water samples, Lee et al. (2011) (Table 5 ) applied the optimized procedure to the detection of noroviruses in environmental water. They combined adsorptive filtration using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich viruses from largevolume surface (200 l) and ground (500 l) water samples. This integrated two-step process led to high volume reduction factors, i.e., 10,000 and 25,000 for surface and ground water samples, respectively (200-5009 for filtration, 509 for organic flocculation), but its recovery efficiency was not evaluated by spiking studies. In the same way, beside spiking Woo et al. (2012) . a Ratio of the virus survival factor in the treated filter to that in the untreated filter, where the virus survival factor in a filter is the number of viruses recovered by elution from the filter divided by the number of viruses removed by the filtration process. b PF PP filter from commercial surgical mask (DuPont TM 01361N), CCF coarse pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 54, 22 lm pore size), FCF fine pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50, 2.7 lm pore size) studies like those detailed in Table 5 , 1 MDS filter cartridges have been widely applied to concentrate enteric viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 6) , ranging from large-volume samples of weakly contaminated water intended for drinking or drinking water production (Borchardt et al. 2003 (Borchardt et al. , 2004 Lee et al. 2014; Sedmak et al. 2005; Verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewater samples with high viral content-to assess the virus removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Kuo et al. 2010; Simmons et al. 2011) . In these tests of field water samples for enteric viruses, 1 MDS filtration was mainly combined with second-stage concentration by organic flocculation as detailed by Fout et al. (2001) in the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) manual of methods for virology. The elution of filter-adsorbed viral particles was mostly performed with an alkaline beef extract solution supplemented or not with glycine (buffers EB3 and EB1 in Table 5 ). The work by Verheyen et al. (2009) is an exception to these common procedures. To concentrate viruses in small-volume samples from drinking water sources, these authors used two filter cartridges in series with no additional concentration step and an alkaline powdered milk solution as elution buffer. They found that 20% (3/15) and 13% (32/247) of surface and ground (well) water sources, respectively, were contaminated with adenoviruses, with very few samples positive to rotavirus (0/15 surface water samples, 6/247 well water sources). Despite the differences in virus concentration methods, these results compare with those obtained by Xagoraraki et al. (2007) and Cheong et al. (2009) for adenovirus detection in surface (14/58 samples, 24%) and ground water (4/29 samples, 14%), respectively. They also agree with data reported by Borchardt et al. (2003) and Cheong et al. (2009) showing the low contamination level of ground water by rotavirus. It is worth noting here, however, that the number of positive samples reported in these viral analyses of water (and the others quoted in Table 6 ) is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection techniques used to assess the presence of viruses, i.e., nucleic acid-based amplification methods such as conventional PCR, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR/RT-PCR or integrated cell culture PCR (ICC/PCR) to determine virus infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Hamza et al. 2011, Mattison and Bidawid 2009; Watzinger et al. 2006) with different detection thresholds.\\nIt emerges from this glance at literature that cellulose-based electropositive filters are still commonly used for viral monitoring of water. These filters are expensive, however, and face competition with cheaper products, in particular nanoalumina fiber filters and glass wool filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . The former, NanoCeram TM filters manufactured by Argonide Corporation (Sanford, Fla., USA), are composed of nanosized (2 nm diameter), alumina-based {mainly boehmite, c-AlO(OH)} fibrilles dispersed in a microglass fiber matrix, resulting in an electropositive filter media with 2-3 lm average pore size Kaledin 2005, 2006) . The latter consist of commercial sodocalcic glass wool coated with mineral oil (type Bourre 725 QN/TECH Loose Wool, Isover Saint-Gobain, Courbevois, France), hand packed into columns or filter holders in the laboratory (Vilagin\\u00e8s et al. 1993) . These glass wool filters harbor electropositive sites while presenting hydrophobic surface characteristics. Efficient enrichment of (seeded or/ and) indigenous viruses from various water samples using NanoCeram (Gibbons et al. 2010; Ikner et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2012) , and glass wool (Deboosere et al. 2011; Lambertini et al. 2008; Wyn-Jones et al. 2011 ) filters has been reported in recent years (see also Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . Compared with 1 MDS filters (Table 5) , NanoCeram filters showed similar , slightly lower (McMinn 2013) or higher (Karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentration efficiency.\\nCommercially available under different pore sizes (0.025-8.0 lm), mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are negatively charged over a wide range of pH values, their overall negative charge increasing with pH (Kessick and Wagner 1978) . Microporous filters in the 0.1-0.45 lm pore size range have been used for ages in laboratory and industry for size-based filtration of bacterial particles and cell debris (surface filters). These and larger pore size filters have been shown to retain enteroviruses, however, despite the much smaller size of viral particles compared to the nominal mean diameter of filter pores (Cliver 1968 ). The presence of salts enhanced virus adsorption to cellulose ester membranes, this effect increasing with the cation valence (i.e., Al 3? [ Mg 2? [ Na ? ) (Wallis et al. 1972) . Acidification of the viral suspension also improved virus adsorption efficiency, even in the absence of exogenously added salts (Sobsey et al. 1973 ). These early results were later confirmed by Lukasik et al. (2000) , who investigated the influence of mono-, di-, and trivalent salts (NaCl, MgCl 2 , and AlCl 3 ) on the adsorption of poliovirus and enterobacteria phages to the MF-Millipore TM membrane filter type HA (0.45 lm pore size) and the electropositive 3M TM Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilter at neutral or acidic pH. At pH 7, salts promoted virus adsorption to HA filter while affecting adsorption to 1 MDS filter. At pH 3.5, more than 95% of the viruses tested adsorbed to HA filter with or without salt added to the viral suspension-the salts interfering again with viral adsorption to 1MDS filter. Furthermore, the addition of urea or Tween 80 to the salt solution affected virus adsorption to both filters at pH 3.5 and HA filter at pH 7. In agreement with previous studies by the same group (Haramoto et al. 2004 (Haramoto et al. , 2005 Lukasik et al. (2000) explained these results by the antichaotropic effect of salts that increased hydrophobic interactions between filters and viruses and was impaired by the chaotropic agent or the detergent. At neutral pH, charge screeening by salt addition reduced electrostatic attractive and repulsive forces between viruses and 1 MDS or HA filter, respectively. Cation-mediated cross-complexation between negative groups on virus and filter surfaces (Kessick and Wagner 1978) and, more particularly, strengthened hydrophobic virusfilter interactions contributed to improving the adsorption efficiency of HA filter. At acidic pH, viruses displayed a positive surface charge and their electrostatic interactions with HA filter switched from repulsive to attractive-and inversely for electropositive 1 MDS filter. The presence of salt probably affected these interactions but was balanced by the promoting effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions.\\nHence, most tests reported so far for virus concentration from water samples using cellulose ester filters (essentially HA filters) have been performed after addition of multivalent cations (mainly Mg 2? ) to the water samples with or without pH adjustment to an acidic level. According to Katayama et al. (2002) , the virus-loaded filters were rinsed with an acidic solution to eliminate remaining cations before elution with NaOH or other alkaline buffers. Haramoto et al. (2004 Haramoto et al. ( , 2005 Haramoto et al. ( , 2007a proposed a variation in the method that consisted in pre-conditioning the filter with Al 3? ions. Aluminum chloride was passed through the filter, making an electropositive ion coating, which avoided cation addition to the water sample. The recovery efficiency of both protocols has been evaluated by seeding water samples with enteric viruses and bacteriophages and quantifying eluted viruses (Table 7) . Similarly to spiking studies (Tables 4, 5) and viral analyses of field water samples (Table 6 ) with electropositive filters, the HA-based filtration/elution process was frequently associated with a secondary concentration step to increase virus concentration factors. Here, centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) using commercial Millipore (Centriprep \\u00d2 , Centricon \\u00d2 or Amicon \\u00d2 ) concentrators was the elective concentration method. These CU units contain a low adsorptive regenerated cellulose membrane (Ultracel \\u00d2 ) whose nominal molecular-weight cutoff ranges between 3 and 100 kDa-a MWCO value of 50 kDa being most frequently selected for secondary concentration of eluted viruses. They are routinely used in laboratories to purify and concentrate biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids from small-volume biological samples (e.g., 2-15 ml for the Centriprep filter unit). Tested or not for virus recovery by spiking experiments, the combined concentration procedures have been extended to the detection of enteric viruses in field water samples including tap (Haramoto et al. 2004 ), sea (Katayama et al. 2002) , river (surface) (Fong et al. 2010; Hamza et al. 2009; Haramoto et al. 2005 ) and waste (Fong et al. 2010; Katayama et al. 2008 ) water (Table 8) . Samples with different volumes were collected according to the water source, i.e., sample volumes increased as the expected contamination level decreased. For instance, Katayama et al. (2002) applied HA filtration, followed by acid rinse of the filter, viral elution with NaOH and secondary concentration of the eluate by CU, to concentrate naturally occurring viruses (noroviruses, enteroviruses and HAV-hepatitis A virus) in seawater samples. Based on the volume reduction factor (2-l sample/2 ml final concentrate, i.e., 1000) and the recovery yield of the two-step process (Table 7) , a virus concentration factor of 670 was reached. Only HAV virus was not detected in any sample tested. Later on, Katayama et al. (2008) followed the same protocol to concentrate enteric viruses in the raw influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Samples of 100-ml volume were collected and submitted to the two-step concentration process, yielding a volume reduction factor of c. 140. The four tested kinds of enteric viruses were detected in all 72 wastewater samples but one lacking norovirus GI (NoV GI). Using PEG precipitation as the secondary concentration step, Hamza et al. (2009) tested river water samples for contamination by enteric viruses and bacteriophages. A volume reduction factor of 5000 (10-l sample/2 ml final concentrate) and virus concentration factors ranging between 1000 (norovirus) and 5000 (adenovirus) (see Table 7 for recovery yields) were obtained. All 41 analyzed samples were found positive for enteric viruses. Human adenovirus and norovirus were detected in 97.5 and 32% of the samples, respectively. Haramoto et al. (2004) illustrated the ability of Al 3? -coated filters to concentrate viruses from large-volume freshwater samples without salt addition by detecting noroviruses in tap water from Tokyo University. Tap water samples (303-l average volume) underwent two successive filtration/elution steps using 293-mm and 47-mm diameter HA filters prior to concentration by CU (final volume: 0.9 ml), which ensured a volume reduction factor higher than 300,000. However, the virus recovery efficiency of the 3-step concentration process was not evaluated. Ten of the 98 tested samples were found positive for noroviruses. These results compare to those reported by Lee et al. (2011) ( Table 5 ) using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich noroviruses from large surface and ground water samples.\\nDespite these promising data, the two viradel methods based on electronegative filters (i.e., addition of MgCl 2 to water samples or filter coating with Al 3? ions before filtration) have been essentially implemented for viral analysis of waters containing high amounts of indigenous viruses, requiring limited sample volumes (Table 8 )-electropositive filter cartridges being more adapted to virus concentration from large volumes of weakly contaminated water (Table 6 ). Beside the above-mentioned work by Haramoto et al. (2004) , only two studies among those detailed in Table 8 describe virus detection in environmental water samples with low viral content, namely drinking water sources after chlorination or without treatment (Rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwater from artesian wells (Chironna et al. 2012) . Both studies used small-volume samples and CU as secondary concentration step, yielding a modest volume reduction factor of 1000. Very few from 202 artesian well water samples were found positive to the tested enteric viruses: none for HAV and enterovirus, 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus (Chironna et al. 2012) . A large proportion (50%) of samples from drinkingwater supplies was positive to adenovirus, however (Rigotto et al. 2010) . These data are compatible with viral analyses of groundwater and water intended for drinking performed using 1 MDS filtration as the first virus concentration step (Table 6 ). It should be noted, however, that the same remark applies to data collected in Table 8 as to those in Table 6 concerning the numbers of virus-positive samples, i.e., their dependence on the virus detection method. This can be illustrated by the two following examples. Using ICC-PCR (measuring infectious viruses), Katayama et al. (2002) detected enteroviruses in 4 of 6 seawater samples from bathing beach, but no sample was found positive by direct RT-PCR. De Paula et al. (2007) found 48/52 river water samples positive for HAV by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, but only 12/52 by nested RT-PCR.\\nAs attested by the large body of literature data quoted above, virus adsorption-elution methods using electropositive or electronegative filters are routinely applied to the primary concentration of waterborne viruses, each type of filter possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. Ultrafiltration is considered another filtration-based option to concentrate viruses from water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). It has been indicated earlier that CU with microconcentrators based on cellulose ultrafiltration discs is commonly used as a secondary concentration step following the viradel process. Hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), however, is considered a potential technique for primary concentration of viruses from large-volume water samples, yielding better virus recoveries than the viradel method performed with either electropositive or electronegative filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Commercial HFUF devices operated in cross-flow mode have been applied to the simultaneous concentration of biological particles, including viruses, spiked in tap (Polaczyk et al. 2008) or reclaimed (Liu et al. 2012) water samples, to virus recovery from seeded tap (Rhodes et al. 2011 ) and estuarine (Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ) water samples, and also, more rarely, to virus recovery from field water samples (Grassi et al. 2010; Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ). Most of these devices are dialyzers that contain synthetic HF made from polysulfone. Following the early work by Belfort et al. (1976) showing that polysulfone HF membranes were superior to cellulose acetate ones for virus concentration, virus concentration experiments using HFUF dialyzers equipped with HF manufactured from cellulose are scarce. An example is given by Liu et al. (2012) . They showed that the Exeltra Plus 210 cellulose triacetate HF dialyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) and the Optiflux \\u00d2 F200NR polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Walthamm, MA, USA) provided similar recovery efficiencies for MS2 and UX174 bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from spiked 10-l and 100-l samples of reclaimed water.\\nAn array of viral infections can be transmitted by the airborne route, in particular via aerosols (droplet nuclei) Tang et al. 2006; Tellier 2006; Verreault et al. 2008 ). Even though virus inactivation rates in the atmosphere are generally higher than those of bacterial and fungal contaminants, virus-containing aerosols can spread worldwide (Despr\\u00e9s et al. 2012) . The threat of viral outbreaks and pandemics such as those caused by SARS coronavirus (Yu et al. 2004 ) and highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus (Tellier 2006) , allied with the fear of bioterrorism using viruses (e.g., smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses) (Barras and Greub 2014) as biological weapons, has encouraged the search for efficient protection equipment against aerosolized virus-containing particles.\\nIndividual respiratory protective devices consist in respirators, i.e., air-filtering face masks designed to protect the wearer against inhalation of a hazardous atmosphere (here airborne infectious aerosols)-opposing to surgical masks designed to protect the environment from contaminants generated by the wearer's exhaled breath (i.e., prevention of surgical infections) . Currently, most ''filtering facepiece'' (FFP) respirators have a multilayer composite structure with a central filtering layer displaying electret properties (Gralton and McLaws 2010) . These electret filters (Thakur et al. 2013) are produced by imparting an electrostatic charge to a nonwoven fibrous mat composed of synthetic polymer fibers such as poly(propylene) (PP) (mainly), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(carbonate) fibers. Electrostatic charging of the filter media is commonly obtained by corona discharge, triboelectrification and electrostatic spinning (Tsai et al. 2002) . Electret filters collect particles through the combined action of mechanical and electrostatic forces (Podg\\u00f3rski 2010; Wang 2001 (CEN 2000) should retain respectively at least 95 and 94% of influent particles (NaCl particles are used as nonbiological surrogate particles) (Rengasamy et al. 2009 ). First worn by surgical teams a hundred years ago to prevent bacterial contamination of patient's open wounds, early surgical masks were constructed from layers of cellulose materials, more particularly cotton cellulose (gauze) (Haller and Colwell 1918) and derivatives (Arnold 1938 ) (see also Belkin 1997) . Much more recently, face masks made from cotton fabrics have been tested as alternative respiratory protective equipment against pandemic outbreaks such as influenza (Dato et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2013; Rengasamy et al. 2010) . Like respirators, current commercially available surgical face masks include several layers of non-woven fabrics with, frequently, a cellulose inner layer in contact with the wearer's face to improve wearer's comfort. However, the filtering layer, usually made of meltblown fibers (Ghosh 2014) , is devoid of electret properties. Since particulate filtration is only mechanical, i.e., less efficient than that of respirators, most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices, standard tests to evaluate their filtration efficacy being less stringent (Oberg and Brosseau 2008) .\\nWhile a number of studies have confirmed that surgical masks logically offer lower protection than respirators against aerosol particles, the effectiveness of both types of face masks at preventing viral respiratory infection, in particular influenza, is still a matter of controversy (Bin-Reza et al. 2012; Cowling et al. 2010; Gralton and McLaws 2010) . The improper facial fit of respirators Coia et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protection efficiency against infectious aerosols. It allows particulate flows outside the filtration area of the mask, resulting in face-seal leaks, i.e., the leakage of infectious particles around the edges of the mask (Grinshpun et al. 2009; Lei et al. 2013) . Mask seal leakage can be minimized by applying existing guidelines for correct donning and fit checking of respirators . Moreover, human face and head form models have been proposed as a tool for designing respirators with improved protection efficiency, simulating interactions between faces and facemasks and describing their fit (Golshahi et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2012) . The accumulation of viral particles at the surface and within the filtration media of respirators, where they can remain viable and infectious for extended periods of time (Coulliette et al. 2013; Sakaguchi et al. 2010) , is another significant problem with which respirator wearers are confronted in the prevention of viral transmission and spread. Incorrect mask handling by the wearer may lead to accidental self-inoculation, cross-contaminations affecting both other healthcare workers and patients, and contamination of fomites (Casanova et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the risk of virus reaerosolization from respirators during extended use, if limited, cannot be ruled out (Fisher et al. 2012) . Recommendations for respirator doffing do exist but have proven insufficient to prevent virus transfer from respirator to healthcare employees' hands and clothing (Casanova et al. 2008) . Adding antiviral properties to the filtration process may contribute to limit the risk of viral transmission by improper handling of used respirators. A number of virucidal facemasks have been developed and patented over the past 15 years (Tiliket et al. 2011) , some of which are commercially available. In the SpectraShield TM Plus respirator masks designed by Nexera Medical Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) (Haas 2008), for instance, two layers of filter media are sandwiched between (inner and outer) antimicrobial layers where a silver-copper zeolite (carrier) antimicrobial agent (Agion \\u00d2 antimicrobial, Sciessent LLC, Wakefield, Mass.) is embedded around the core of synthetic fibers (Fosshield \\u00d2 , Foss Manufacturing, Hampton, NH). The Biofriend TM Biomask TM FFP respirator, manufactured by Filligent Ltd. (Hong Kong) and distributed by Medline Industries, Inc. (Mundelein, Ill.) , is another four-layered device in which the melt-blown PP filtration layer is inserted between an inner layer of spunbond PP and two antiviral layers, namely a cellulose/polyester layer containing copper and zinc ions and an outer layer of spunbond PP treated with a low pH (citric acidacidified) hydrophilic plastic coating (Davison 2012; Stewart et al. 2014) . The outer layer absorbs infectious aerosol droplets and viruses are denaturated by exposure to citric acid. In the second layer, inactivation of viruses with damaged structures is completed by the virucidal effect of divalent metal cations. Contributing to the overall antiviral efficiency of the structure, the cellulosic component of this layer is a sulphated or sulfonated rayon fabric (Stewart et al. 2012 (Stewart et al. , 2014 to which a variety of viral human pathogens bind via the cationic sites of viral envelopes/capsids.\\nBeside the commercial Biomask TM respirator, various composite structures designed for filtrationinactivation of airborne microbial contaminants, where cellulosic materials play an active antimicrobial role, have been patented in recent years Bernard 2006; Nakamura and Nakamura 2011; Tsutsumi 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhong 2011) . Several of them are based on bacterial cellulose layers/coatings provided with an antimicrobial component, i.e., silver (Zhong 2011) or zeolite-supported silver (Nakamura and Nakamura 2011) nanoparticles, and chitosan (Zhang et al. 2012) . The respiratory protective mask described by Zhong (2011) comprises a three-layer bacterial cellulose membrane whose middle layer contains silver nanoparticles. The antimicrobial facemask invented by Nakamura and Nakamura (2011) includes two base cloth elements both of which are made of a woven textile (gauze), a nonwoven cellulose fabric (e.g., rayon), or a porous sheet (e.g., a 0.3-0.5 mm sliced sheet of urethane sponge). The first base cloth is filled with bacterial cellulose nanofibers that retain silver zeolite and a humectant (e.g., trehalose or 1,3-butylene glycol) in their network structure. Additional antimicrobial properties are provided to the mask by impregnating the second base cloth with a carboxylic acid (e.g., citric acid). Zhang et al. (2012) also used bacterial cellulose in a composite antimicrobial material suitable for respiratory protective masks. A nonwoven polymer fabric Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) 16:455-489 479 was coated with a film of bacterial cellulose mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improve the film-forming properties, mechanical strength and air permeability of the coating-and chitosan, a non-sulfated polysaccharide produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin that displays strong antibacterial potency (Kong et al. 2010; Rabea et al. 2003 ) and, to a lesser extent, antiviral activity (Rabea et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2012 ).\\nIn the antimicrobial air filtration device proposed by Bernard (2006) , cellulose derivatives-more particularly, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common pharmaceutical excipient for enteric coating of tablets and capsules with antiviral activity (Pirrone et al. 2011 )-were used as ''biocidal prophylactic compounds'' to provide the classical filter media (e.g., a nonwoven PP web, electrostatically charged or not) with antimicrobial properties. Cellulose derivatives could be incorporated as fibers or particles (micronized fibers) into the air filtration device either in a separate layer positioned before or after the filter media, or deposited onto the outer surface of the filter media relative to the air flow direction. To illustrate this invention, handsheets prepared from CAP fibers intermixed or not with CAP particles were successfully tested for virucidal efficacy by exposure to an aerosol challenge of enterobacteria phage \\u00d8X174.\\nBy exploiting the antimicrobial properties of dialdehyde polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose dialdehydes, Baney et al. (2012) proposed a new method for producing low-cost virucidal filters suitable for respiratory protective masks. The treatment of a standard cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50 filter paper) with sodium periodate improved its antiviral potency due to oxidation of some cellulose to dialdehyde cellulose inside the filter. Challenged with aerosols of MS2 enterobacteria phage at high relative humidity (90% at 23\\u00b0C), the treated filter showed higher filtration efficiency than a control, untreated one, i.e., better removal of viable viral particles (Plaque Forming Units) joined to a lower resistance to air flow (pressure drop)-due to increased pore size distribution (Woo et al. 2011) . Higher inactivation of MS2 virus by the treated filter was also highlighted, confirming an improvement of its disinfection capability (Woo et al. 2011 ). However, the filtration and inactivation of airborne viruses were less effective at lower moisture content of the filter, i.e., at air humidity levels commonly encountered in hospital settings, in particular operating rooms (Balaras et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, the inhalation resistance of the treated filter remained too high for application to respiratory protective masks. The same pros and cons apply to cellulose paper filters treated by immersion into aqueous suspensions of dialdehyde starch (DAS) (Woo et al. 2012) . While this treatment did not affect the removal efficiency of viable MS2 viruses from aerosols at high relative humidity, virus survival on the treated filters was reduced (Fig. 5 ) and the pressure drop decreased as DAS concentration increased. The drop in air flow resistance remained insufficient for practical application to respirators. DAS treatment of a PP filter from a commercial FFP mask did not modify the filtration parameters (virus removal efficiency and pressure drop) of the filter but significantly improved its biocidal efficacy (Fig. 5 )-an opening of this treatment towards the development of virucidal facemasks. Another example of cellulose filter material treated with cellulose derivatives to yield antiviral properties is given by Tsurumi (Tsutsumi 2009 ). This inventor devised a low-cost virucidal mask filter made of a standard cellulose nonwoven fabric impregnated with water extracts of sulfonated or aminated styrenegraft cellulose. To reinforce the water retention properties of the filter media, a superabsorbent resin such as poly(acrylic acid) was added to the graft cellulose extract before impregnation of the fabric or incorporated into a separate layer covering the impregnated fabric. Low (hydrogen ions from sulfonic acid groups) or high (hydroxyl ions generated by aminated groups) pH conditions inside the hydrated material were claimed to make it virucidal against influenza A virus and caliciviruses. The patent gives no illustration of such antiviral properties, however.\\nStudies published by Tiliket et al. (2011) and Catel-Ferreira et al. (2015) present another type of cellulosebased material for airborne virus filtration in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulose material, i.e., commercial Kimwipes \\u00d2 (KW) wipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., Dallas, Tex.), was chemically modified by coating with a synthetic polymer, i.e., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Tiliket et al. 2011) or grafting of an antiviral agent, i.e., catechin (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) . The filtration efficiency of the modified filter media was first tested on aerosolized T4D viruses (Enterobacteria phage T4, Doermann's strain T4D). Then the treated filter was inserted inside a commercial medical mask in place of its cellulosic layer (Kolmi M24001 mask, Kolmi-Hopen, Saint-Barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'Anjou, France), and the reconstructed mask was challenged with TD4 aerosols to evaluate its virus removal efficiency. Both treatments significantly improved the virus capture factor (ratio of upstream to downstream PFU contents) of KW cellulose wipes and of reconstructed commercial masks compared to original masks and to masks reconstructed with untreated wipes. In these studies, the breathability of reconstructed masks was not quantified, nor was the virus survivability on the modified filter media. However, additional filtration experiments using aerosols of influenza A virus (low pathogenic H5N2 strain) showed that challenged viral particles accumulated in PEI functionalized KW layers with no loss in number and infectivity (Tiliket et al. 2011) . Thus these modified masks showed no virucidal effect, the PEImodified layers behaving like an electret media owing to the polycationic character of PEI. On the other hand, since catechin and catechin-grafted wipes showed antiviral activity against T4D viruses in liquid media (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) , it may be assumed that part of viruses accumulated in excess in the treated wipes were inactivated by the polyphenol agent, i.e., the reconstructed masks were actually virucidal.\\nDespite these few examples, the use of cellulosic media in filtration devices aimed at the capture of airborne viral particles remains now very limited compared to filtration of virus-contaminated liquid samples. While patented, several cellulose-based, virucidal filter media designed for insertion in air filtering face masks have not been commercially developed yet.\\nBesides the wearing of personal respiratory protective equipment, another aspect of the fight against airborne infections lies in the decontamination of indoor air in healthcare facilities, and, more generally, of air processed through heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the built environment. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are the primary technology used for particulate removal in these collective protection devices-allied with UV irradiation, ozonation or air ionization to yield indoor air decontamination (Bolashikov and Melikov 2009; Jacob et al. 2013 )-and may be complemented with a photytocatalyst such as TiO 2 to improve the inactivation of accumulated microorganisms Pigeot-Remy et al. 2014 ). Since HEPA filters are essentially made of glass fibers, they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retentive properties will not be detailed further.\\nMost frequently associated with other virus reduction (virus clearance of biopharmaceuticals) or concentration (viral analysis of water) steps, size-exclusion and/ or adsorptive (charge mediated) filtration is an essential tool to fight against viral contaminants in aqueous media. Owing to inherent properties of cellulose, including mechanical strength and hydrophilicity (that opposes protein adsorption and biofouling), allied with widespread availability and biocompatibility, cellulose-based materials are still widely present in viral filters. Developed commercially over the past thirty years, several cellulosic filter media have been and continue to be used for both routine analyses in laboratories and academic research studies aimed at improving the filtration performance, generating a wealth of data quantifying the efficiency of virus removal or recovery/concentration from biologic or water samples, respectively.\\nAs concerns biopharmaceutical compounds, these data arise from validation studies of the filtration step performed by spiking intermediate biologic solutions (mostly blood proteins) from multistage purification processes with known titers of viral particles. Regenerated cellulose HF Planova filters N15-N35, operated in the dead-end mode as a single filter or two units in series, were shown to provide LRV values ranging between 4 and 7, on the average. Increasingly tested since their launching in 1989, these cellulosic filters compete with filter media made of synthetic polymers such as PVDF (e.g., Viresolve \\u00d2 NFP-Normal Flow Parvovirus-from EMD Millipore; Ultipor \\u00d2 VF Grade DV20/DV50 from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) or PES (e.g., Millipore Viresolve \\u00d2 Pro; Virosart \\u00d2 HS/HC/CPV from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). The hydrophilic nature of cellulose fibers is a definite advantage of Planova filters over others for virus removal from protein solutions, minimizing flux decline due to proteindominated filter plugging (cake formation) at constant pressure (normal-flow) filtration (Rathore et al. 2014 ). However, they are usually operated at lower flow rate than filters made of synthetic polymers whose operating pressure is higher. Hydrophilic modified PVDF membrane filters designed for virus removal from high-concentration protein solutions at high flow rate are being developed by several manufacturers, including Asahi-Kasei (i.e., Planova TM BioEX filters, launched in 2009).\\nMany studies have also been reported to assess the virus concentration efficiency of the viradel method using spiked water samples, prior to the detection of waterborne viral contaminants in field water samples. In this method, cellulosic filters, whether positively or negatively charged, are used for adsorptive capture of viruses before virus recovery by elution with a lowvolume eluent. Electropositive filters are more particularly suitable for virus capture in low-contaminated, high-volume water samples, e.g., samples of groundwater or source water for drinking water production ( Table 6) . Though routinely used, these filters are expensive and face competition with nanoalumina fiber filters (e.g., the patented Ahlstrom Disruptor \\u00d2 electroadsorptive filter) (Levi 2011 ) and glass wool filters, which are cheaper. On the other hand, efficient virus adsorption by electronegative filters-the standard, cost-effective mixed cellulose ester membrane microfilters-requires impractical sample pre-treatment: their use is limited to viral analysis of highlycontaminated waters, for which small-volume samples are sufficient (Table 8) .\\nCellulose nanomaterials may represent a promising perspective for cellulosic materials in their application to viral filtration of liquid samples, yielding filtration membranes with higher mechanical strength, water permeability, surface hydrophilicicy and resistance to biofouling (Carpenter et al. 2015) . Ma et al. (2011) have presented a composite membrane consisting of an electrospun poly(acrylonitrile) nanofibrous scaffold deposited on a non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) support. This two-layered membrane was coated by a layer of cellulose nanofibers and tested for retention of MS-2 phages. At acidic pH, phage particles were adsorbed by the negatively charged cellulose nanofiber coating, yielding a LRV value [3.7. Later on, the same nanofibrous composite membrane was doped with cellulose nanofibers functionalized by grafting with poly(vinylamine) . MS-2 phages were adsorbed at neutral pH onto positively charged amino-modified nanofibers, with a LRV value of 4. Metreveli et al. (2014) and Asper et al. (2015) have presented a size-exclusionbased filter paper made of pure cellulose nanofibers for removal of swine influenza A and murine leukemia viruses, respectively. These non-woven materials could be tailored to ensure efficient virus retention (Gustafsson and Mihranyan 2016a). Self assembled into nanosheets to yield ''mille feuille'' structures, they showed efficient removal of parvoviruses (Gustafsson et al. 2016b) : maybe a new filtration media for viral clearance?\\nA number of air filtration devices designed for individual protection against airborne viruses also include cellulosic materials. While published data on the filtration performance of cellulosic media for removal of viruses from air are scarce, industrial research is more apparent, in particular in Asian countries (China, Japan) where airborne pollution is a matter of great concern-the main objective being to add virucidal properties to the filtration media so as to inactivate accumulated viral particles. Therefore, some innovative media have been patented over the past few years with, however, no commercial development to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1405,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Radoshevich, Lilliana.

rate of high bmi and hypertens in our covid-19 patient cohort were veri similar to those report in a recent prospect large-scal report on french breast cancer patient [ 21 ] , suggest that these

against influenza virus [ 3 ] . it is becom increas appar that an effect mucos adjuv is a high prioriti in the develop of effici mucos vaccin . \\n a synthet dsrna , term poly(i : c ) , has been found be abl to boost immun respons sinc the 1960s [ 10 , 45 ] . recent , poly(i : c ) was discov to function as an adjuv through it interact with tlr3 , which in turn activ the nf-\\u03bab pathway , result in stabl matur of dcs , activ of nk cell and longer-tim surviv of activ cd4 + t cell in vitro [ 42 ] . ichinoh et al. [ 11 ] report that intranas vaccin of hemaglutinin ( ha ) adjuv with poly(i : c ) can induc protect against influenza viral infect in mice . brian r. sloat also show that nasal immun with anthrax pa plus poly(i : c ) can enhanc the product of mucos and system immun [ 34 ] . therefor , poly(i : c ) repres anoth potenti adjuv . howev , poly(i : c ) itself is unsuit as a potenti adjuv becaus it is toxic and can be rapid hydrolyz in human when use alon [ 6 ] . sever poly(i : c ) deriv have been suggest , such as poly(iclc ) , which is poli ( i : c ) contain poly-l-lysin and carboxymethylcellulos [ 2 ] , to minim observ defici of poli ( i : c ) . \\n pika is a particular deriv of poli ( i : c ) compris kanamycin and calcium chlorid [ 25 ] specif igg and ifn-\\u03b3 respons in mice [ 33 ] . most recent studi also show that pika can provid broad-spectrum prophylaxi against a number of influenza a virus and coadministr of pika with a poor immunogen h5n1 subunit vaccin can lead to antigen spare and quantit and qualit improv of the immun respons over those achiev with an unadjuv vaccin in mice [ 18 , 19 ] . \\n in the present studi , we demonstr that the intraperiton and intranas co-administr of this \\n product [ 24 ] was inactiv with formaldehyd . pika is an improv adjuv formul compris a deriv of poly(i : c ) , kanamycin and calcium chlorid [ 23 , 33 ] , which was manufactur in complianc with good manufactur practic by newbiom pika pte ltd , singapor . \\n femal balb/c mice , 6 to 8 week of age , were purchas from hubei cdc and maintain in spf environ throughout the experi . the mice were immun through either an intranas ( i.n . ) or intraperiton ( i.p . ) rout with 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov or 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov plus the indic dose of pika . mice immun with pbs serv as a negat control . the protocol for intranas immun requir the mice to be anesthet slight with sodium pentobarbit and held invert with nose up until droplet of vaccin that were appli to both extern nare were complet inhal [ 13 ] . all intranas immun reagent were suspend with pbs . individu mice receiv 10 \\u00b5l of inocul for five time with a 30 min rest interv between inocul ( total volum , 50 \\u00b5l ) . for intraperiton immun , vaccin composit were adjust with pbs to a consist 200 \\u00b5l dose . each mous receiv three immun with a 2-week interv between each immun . \\n all sampl were collect two week after the final immun as previous describ [ 9 ] . blood sampl were collect by retro-orbit plexus punctur . saliva was obtain after intraperiton inject with 20 \\u00b5g of carbamylcholin chlorid . the vagin tract of individu mice was wash with 30\\u00b5l pbs for three time , with a total volum of 90\\u00b5l. after remov fece , small intestin tissu were weigh , cut into small piec , mix with pbs ( 100 mg of small intestin in 200\\u00b5l of pbs ) , and rock at 4 \\u2103 for 5 h. for collect of lung wash fluid , the trachea was expos surgic and the oral portion of trachea was clamp , a 1-ml syring equip with a 22-gaug needl was insert into the trachea , 200\\u00b5l of pbs was inject into the peripher airway , and five cycl of aspir and inject were repeat [ 36 ] . after centrifug at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min , supernat of all sampl were collect and store at -80 \\u00b0 c befor antibodi detect . \\n the anti-sars-cov titer of each sampl was determin by elisa . the specif antibodi in \\n the neutral test was carri out with pseudotyp sars-cov produc as qu et al. \\n describ previous with a slight modif [ 31 ] . \\n the western blot assay was carri out accord to the protocol in molecular clone [ 32 ] . briefli , a segment of spike ( s ) protein ( 401~750aa ) of sars-cov , which was express in vitro and name s ' [ 27 ] , was separ by sds-page on a 5 % stack polyacrylamid gel in combin with a 12 % separ gel . \\n the separ protein were then transfer to a nitrocellulos membran for 2 h with a 300 ma current . after block with 3 % bsa in pbs for 2 h at \\n the statist signific of the differ between group was calcul by student 's t-test for two group or by tukey 's test use anova for three or more group . differ were consid not signific when p>0.05 . \\n the optim concentr of the pika adjuv was identifi by immun mice intraperiton or intranas with 50 \\u00b5g , 100 \\u00b5g , or 250 \\u00b5g of pika mix with 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov antigen . [ 17 , 44 ] . the abil to induc a secretori ( fig. 3a ) , wherea a 500-fold ( p=0.002 ) and 10-fold ( p=0.037 ) increas of siga titer could be induc when pika was coadministr with antigen by intranas and interperiton respect . howev , no specif siga titer could be detect in lung wash fluid ( fig.    3a ) although neutral activ could be detect in the lung ( fig. 2d ) . one concern was how the the lung \\n we also assay the sars-cov specif igg in the pool mucos sampl as well as in the serum sampl \\n the result are summar in fig. 4 . pika could increas a specif igg respons in intestin , saliva , vagina and lung ( fig. 4a , black bar ) were determin in dilut sampl use elisa . each bar repres the arithmet mean titer of individu group \\u00b1 se . the statist signific of the differ between group was calcul by use transform data ( log2 ) of elisa mean titer by student 's t-test for two group , or by tukey 's test use anova for three or more group . ag , 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov alon ; \\n ag+pika , 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov plus 100 \\u00b5g of pika . this approach could help to elicit hiv immunogen specif iga and igg respons in vagin , fecal and saliva sampl [ 4 ] . a parenter administ viruslik particl even elicit 90 % to 100 % efficaci against infect and pre-invas diseas in previous uninfect individu [ 15 ] . \\n for determin correl between neutral activ and antibodi in serum and mucos secret , both igg and iga respons in serum and in mucos secret were test . in our studi , neutral activ was detect in lung sampl from three group of mice , in which onli specif igg but not iga could be detect ( fig. 2 - 4 ) . antibodi analysi also indic that it was specif igg but not specif iga respons at mucos site that was correl with neutral activ . it is veri possibl that mucos igg could also play an import role in contribut to the neutral activ at mucos site . it has been propos [ 41 ] , serum igg induc in parenter immun could find it way to the mucosa to exert protect effect . the relat high concentr of igg seen at particular mucos site may reflect a combin of constitut transcellular or paracellular transport from the system compart and specif transport mechan [ 41 ] . \\n therefor , detect of igg respons in mucos site is also use for evalu of mucos immun respons and relat neutral activ . \\n becaus sars-cov infect occur at mucos surfac , such as lung , digest surfac and even vagin surfac [ 20 , 21 , 26 , 38 , 40 ] , the induct of a neutral activ which could block virus attach and infect is more import in sars-cov prevent . our studi show that pika was effect at induc neutral activ at mucos site when co-administ by intraperiton and intranas immun ( fig. 2 ) . intranas immun appear less effect than intraperiton immun at elicit neutral activ , even when adjuv with pika . this may partial result from certain loss of vaccin antigen , dilut by mucos secret , captur by mucus gel , attack by proteas and nucleas , or exclus by epitheli cell when deliv through mucos rout [ 30 ] . \\n howev , it should be note that intranas immun could induc much higher specif iga respons than intraperiton immun . mani studi alreadi demonstr that mucos siga can inhibit viral infect via immun exclus , intracellular virus neutral , and transepitheli transport of immun complex [ 17 , 28 , 44 ] . even rotavirus vp6-specif iga monoclon antibodi that lack neutral activ can protect mice against infect by ] rotavirus via an intracellular neutral mechan [ 5 ] . sars-cov-specif siga may also provid a similar kind of protect against sars-cov invas at mucos site in the absenc of classic neutral activ . if this is true , the in vitro neutral activ may onli reflect partial correl with the protect effect of immun respons . \\n the adjuvant of pika may be most deriv from it main compon poly(i : c ) . howev , the adjuv mechan of poly(i : c ) is not clear understood yet although it is believ to be relat with to dsrna structur and tlr3 mediat immun respons . in-vivo , the presenc of viral dsrna can trigger cellular immun respons to viral infect through the activ of dsrna-depend enzym includ pkr , and the ifn-induc 2'-5'-adenyl synthase/rnas l system [ 12 , 16 ] . in addit , mammalian tlr3 's can recogn viral dsrna , lead to the activ of nf-\\u03bab and the product of type 1 interferon which can serv as a bridg between the innat and adapt immun system [ 1 ] . takeshi [ 11 ] . \\n for develop and applic of an adjuv for human use , the prioriti is it safeti . ct is the most potent known mucos adjuv , but it has advers side effect , such as nasal discharg in human . here we determin the mucos adjuvant of a new adjuv , pika , which is a deriv of poly(i : c ) . \\n poly(i : c ) itself is toxic to human and can be rapid hydrolyz despit it strong adjuvant [ 6 ] . pika is an improv adjuv which was formul as a [ 26 ] . all togeth , pika is well formul as a stabl and safe adjuv . \\n in summari , we have demonstr that both intraperiton and intranas administr of pika as an adjuv can signific rais the humor immun respons with neutral activ against sars-cov in serum and mucos site . therefor , pika is a good adjuv candid and can be also use as mucos vaccin .\",\n          \"abstract viral filtrat is a critic step in the purif of biolog and in the monitor of microbiolog water qualiti . viral filter are also essenti protect element against airborn viral particl . the present review first focus on cellulosebas filter media current use for size-exclus and/or adsorpt filtrat of virus from biopharmaceut and environment water sampl . data from spike studi quantifi the viral filtrat perform of cellulos filter are detail , i.e. , first , the virus reduct capac of regener cellulos hollow fiber filter in the manufactur process of blood product and , second , the effici of virus recovery/concentr from water sampl by the viradel ( virus adsorption-elut ) method use charg modifi , electroposit cellulos filter or convent electroneg cellulos ester microfilt . viral analysi of field water sampl by the viradel techniqu is also survey . this review then describ cellulose-bas filter media use in individu protect equip against airborn viral pathogen , present innov filtrat media with virucid properti . some pros and con of cellulos viral filter and perspect for cellulose-bas materi in viral filtrat are underlin in the review . virus capture/purification/concentr is critic in a number of biopharmaceut and clinic applic . valid of virus clearanc is essenti in the manufactur of therapeut protein , in particular blood product ( bryant and klein 2007 ; klamroth et al. 2014 ; de mendoza et al. 2012 ; radosevich and burnouf 2010 ; shukla et al. 2007 ) . on the other hand , large-scal , effici purif scheme of viruses/ virus-lik particl are requir for the product of prophylact vaccin and gene therapi vector ( rodrigu et al. 2007 ; segura et al. 2006 segura et al. , 2011 vicent et al. 2011a , b ) . virus inactiv technolog are common use to fulfil viral safeti . they includ physic ( e.g. , heat applic , ultraviolet-and gamma irradi ) and chemic method ( e.g. , solvent/deterg treatment ) or their combin ( e.g. , exposur to photosensit plus uv light ) ( bryant and klein 2007 ; klamroth et al. 2014 ; klein and bryant 2009 ; pelleti et al. 2006 ; prows 2013 ; radosevich and burnouf 2010 ; solheim 2008 ) . common method for virus captur includ filtrat ( charcosset 2006 ; grein et al. 2013 ; liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ) and chromatographi in column or membran configur ( charcosset 2006 ; gottschalk 2008 ; liu et al. 2010 ; orr et al. 2013 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ; segura et al. 2011 ) . viral filtrat is usual the final purif step in the downstream process of biopharmaceut product , e.g. , monoclon antibodi ( fig. 1 ) , follow one or more chromatographi '' polish '' step that contribut to the overal virus remov effici of the process befor concentr of the purifi product . filtrat technolog are also extens use for the captur and concentr of waterborn viral pathogen ( gibson 2014 ) from drink , environment , recreat or wast water sampl ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; ikner et al. 2012 ) . in addit , particul air filter are use in person respiratori protect equip ( i.e. , face mask and respir ) cohen and birkner 2012 ; rengasami et al. 2004 ) to ensur shortrang protect of wearer against airborn pathogens-which includ a number of virus ( tang et al. 2006 ) -and in air purifiers/clean to limit longrang aerosol transmiss of infect in healthcar set ( hyttinen et al. 2011 ; tang et al. 2006 ) . \\n cellulos membran microfilt have been use routin for age in laboratori to perform the socal '' steril filtrat '' ( cold steril ) , i.e. , the absolut remov of bacteria , yeast and mold but not virus ( walsh and denyer 2012 ) from heat-sensit liquid media . howev , mani virus filtrat devic current implement are made from cellulos and it deriv . some eighti year ago , gradocol , grade collodion ( cellulos nitrat ) membran filter ( elford 1931 ; bauer and hugh 1934 ) have been extens use in ultrafiltr to estim the size of sever medic import virus such as foot-and-mouth diseas ( galloway and elford 1931 ) , vaccinia ( elford and andrew 1932 ) , herp ( elford et al. 1933 ) , poliomyel ( elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza ( elford et al. 1936 ) ( see also ferri ( 1936 ) for an exhaust review ) . later on , commerci mix cellulos ester filter with veri low pore size , name vf ( virus fine ) , vm ( virus medium ) and vc ( virus coars ) grade filter produc by millipor ( billerica , ma , usa-a subsidiari of merck kgaa , darmstadt , germani ) , have also been appli to virus ultrafiltr for group by size assess ( hsiung 1965 ) . as part of a seri of paper survey the antivir applic of polysaccharide-bas materi , the present review focus on viral filtrat use cellulos filter media-most of which are commerci avail product that have been extens test over the past twenti year for the removal/concentration/purif of viral particl from liquid sampl , i.e. , biopharmaceut ( name blood product ) and environment ( raw or treat ) water sampl . the applic of cellulose-bas filter in individu respiratori protect devic protect the wearer against airborn viral pathogen is also detail . polysaccharide-bas chromatograph adsorb for viral clearanc or recovery/purif of virus or virus-lik particl will be present elsewher . \\n in the process of biolog product , virus remov from the product stream while provid maximum product recoveri is a critic task . it is more particular difficult to elimin small viral particl such as parvovirus , which may contamin blood product and mammalian cell cultur use in the product of recombin protein ( charcosset 2006 ) . viral filter develop to answer this challeng are typic membran ( screen ) filter ensur a size-bas reject of viral particl via a siev mechan . given the size of virus , rang rough from 20 ( parvovirida ) to 400 nm ( poxvirida ) ( segura et al. 2011 ) , viral filtrat stand between microfiltr and ultrafiltr among pressure-driven filtrat process ( fig. 2 ) , though it is frequent but incorrect ( van rei and zydney 2007 ) classifi as nanofiltr ( burnouf et al. 2005 ) . \\n 2.1 regener cellulos hollow fiber ( hf ) membran filter \\n common virus filtrat membran are made from poly(ethersulfon ) ( pes ) , poly(vinyliden fluorid ) ( pvdf ) , and regener cellulos ( burnouf and radosevich 2003 ; carter and lutz 2002 ; liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ) . among the latter , the commerci planova tm filter ( asahi kasei medic , tokyo , japan ) have been wide use to clear virus from biolog produc pharmaceut , in particular blood product . planova filter are compos of cuprammonium regener cellulos hf ( bemberg tm cupro fiber ) , prepar from cellulos cuprammonium spin solut via microphas separ under precis spin condit ( tsurumi et al. 1990b , c ) . the wall of each hf has a threedimension web structur of pore consist of larg , bulki void pore interconnect by fine capillari ( tsurumi et al. 1990a , b , c ) ( fig. 3 ) . dure filtrat , as the feed solut contain the product of interest is circul through the hf bore , virus accumul in the larg , bulki void pore of the fiber network while the product solut pass through the capillari pore . sinc the hf wall is sever ten of micromet thick ( fig. 4 ) , virus are captur gradual insid the porous structur that can be consid multi-lay ( 100 - 200 layer ) ( hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ) . henc , planova filter behav like '' membran depth filter '' ( walsh and denyer 2012 ) oper on the basi of size exclus . they offer a choic of 4 nomin mean pore size , name 15 nm ( 15n ) , 19 nm ( 20n ) , 35 nm ( 35n ) and 72 nm (75n)-the larg pore 75n model be essenti use as a prefilt to remov impur or aggreg prior to final virus filtration-and can be oper in normal ( dead-end/flow through ) or tangenti flow ( cross flow ) filtrat mode ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . planova filter have emerg to answer a publichealth problem of worldwid magnitud , i.e. , blood contamin by hiv ( hamamoto et al. 1989 ; manab et al. 1989 ) and hepat virus ( yuasa et al. 1991 ; sekiguchi et al. 1989 sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . tabl 1 give exampl of viral clearanc studi assess the capac of planova filter to remov virus from blood product . in these viral clearanc assay , product stream result from success , scaleddown purif step repres of the manufactur process of the product ( kundu and reindel 2007 ) , were artifici contamin ( '' spike '' ) with model virus of differ size ( tabl 2 ) ( at much higher concentr than what might be common found in the product intermedi ) befor be submit to filtrat . the virus remov effici of the filtrat step was express as lrv ( log reduct valu , i.e. , log ratio of the viral load in the spike product feed stream to that recov in the product filtrat ) , which impli that residu virus infect can never be reduc to zero but may be great reduc mathemat ( ich 1999 ) . minimum lrv valu were most frequent given . they were estim when no virus could be detect in filter sampl take into account the detect limit of the assay ( viral titer estim as 1 infecti unit per sampl volum ) . from the measur lrvs , the filtrat oper is usual classifi as effect ( lrv [ 4 ) , moder effect ( 1 \\\\ lrv \\\\ 4 ) or makino et al. ( 1994 ) rev environ sci biotechnol ( 2017 ) ineffect ( lrv \\\\ 1 ) ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . sinc filtrat complement other viral clearanc method in the downstream process of biotherapeut ( brorson 2007 ; klamroth et al. 2014 ; shukla et al. 2007 ) , sever studi quot in tabl 1 also report lrvs for common virus reduct step such as inactiv by pasteur ( gr\\u00f6ner 2014 ; gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2007 ) or solvent/deterg treatment ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 ) , and chromatograph captur ( gr\\u00f6ner 2014 ; gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ) . virus remov dure the plasma fraction process ( bryant and klein 2007 ) lead from the crude plasma pool to the product ( immunoglobulin here ) stream has also been quantifi ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 ) . overal virus reduct factor obtain by addit of success lrvs are given in these work , as illustr by tabl 3 . in the virus spike studi quot in tabl 1 , the actual viral filtrat step was preced by prefiltr to elimin viral and/or protein aggreg that might be present in the spike product solut . the presenc of aggreg virus may lead to overestim of size exclus effect while contribut with protein aggreg to the foul of viral filter , which reduc the membran hydraul permeabl and may affect virus retent ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . pre-filtr was perform on the spikevirus stock suspens ( caballero et al. 2014 ; gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; robert et al. 2010 ) on the product intermedi befor virus inocul ( gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ) , and/or on the virus furuya et al. ( 2006 ) and terpstra et al. ( 2006 ) cpv canin parvovirus b19 v gr\\u00f6ner ( and terpstra et al. ( 2006 terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spike materi ( chtourou et al. 2007 ; dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 terpstra et al. , 2007 . for pre-filtr of the virus prepar , micro filter with a pore size adapt to the spike virus size , i.e. , slight lower than the virus size , were use to remov cell aggreg but not singl viral particles-usu pore size rang between 0.1 and 0.45 lm . micro filter with 0.1 - 0.2 lm pore size ( koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2007 ; , but also 75n ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ) and 35n ( chtourou et al. 2007 ) . planova viral filter were use to pre-filtr the spike product solut . in the latter work , the associ in seri of 35n and 15n filter led to effici remov of small virus such as ppv ( chtourou et al. 2007 ) . this was not the case when 35n was use as the main viral filter after pre-filtr with 75n ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ) , which confirm previous date show that the 35 nm pore size was too larg to retain the smallest viral particl ( furuya et al. 2006 ; hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ) . both 20n ( caballero et al. 2014 ; furuya et al. 2006 ; gr\\u00f6ner 2014 ) and 15n ( caballero et al. 2014 ; robert et al. 2010 ; terpstra et al. 2007 ; planova filter and their combin ( gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ) show effect virus remov over a wide rang of viral particl size ( tabl 1 ) . as a general rule , the remov effici of the filter increas with the ratio of pore size to virus size , as illustr by gr\\u00f6ner ( 2014 ) and terpstra et al. ( 2007 ) . this was also demonstr by robert et al. ( 2010 ) by filtrat poliovirus type 1 ( a picorvanirus ) through planova filter manufactur with differ pore size , rang between 15 ( lrv = 6.9 ) and 35 nm ( lrv = 0.2 ) . the two-filt combin were global more effici than singl filter at remov small virus from spike protein intermedi , though two 15n filter connect in parallel for tangenti filtrat ( koenderman et al. 2012 ) yield lrvs quit similar to those obtain use 15n alon ( terpstra et al. 2006 ) . care should be taken when compar vertic the data collect in tabl 1 , howev . in addit to the size of viral particl and filter pore , the result of such virus-spik studi are depend on a number of process paramet such as the filtrat oper condit ( filtrat mode , transmembran pressur , volum per filter area , tempera-tur \\u2026 ) , the characterist of the product feed stream ( ph , conduct , natur and concentr of the product \\u2026 ) , or els the puriti level and concentr of the virus spike . moreov , sever studi includ pre-filtr ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ) or viral inactiv ( koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 ) in the calcul of lrvs . this variabl in test condit for filtration-bas virus remov make difficult ani comparison between lrvs collect from multipl sourc as in tabl 1 , even though some result ( caballero et al. 2014 ; hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ; robert et al. 2010 ) contradict it influenc on filtrat perform , underlin the robust of the filtrat process . also , some variat in virus remov capac may occur between commerci filter modul owe to their manufactur from differ batch of hf , as illustr by robert et al. ( 2010 ) for 15n filter . \\n like membran microfiltr , depth filtrat is wide use as a clarif step in biopharmaceut purif to ensur remov of cell debri , larg aggreg and contamin from the product stream prior to purif process such as column/membran chromatographi and viral filtration/inactiv step ( liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ; vicent et al. vicent et al. 2011a , b ) . commerci avail depth filter current employ in bioprocess are compos of cellulos fiber with a porous inorgan filter aid and a resin binder , general cation . for instanc , the zeta plus tm filter media ( 3 m purif inc.-form cuno , meriden , ct , usa ) is compos of a cellulos fiber depth matrix contain silica-bas filter-aid materi and posit charg by chemic bound of a cation charg modifi ( ostreich 1991 ) . \\n vari retent rate are avail ( 0.1 - 1.0 lm ) . the tripl layer a1hc filter media from emd millipor includ two depth filtrat layer ( cellulos ? diatomac earth ) of differ grade and a 0.1 lm-pore-s micropor membran pre-filt made of mix cellulos ester ( van rei and zydney 2007 ) . henc , these cellulos depth filter reli on both size exclus and electrostat adsorpt bind to effect separ ( liu et al. 2010 ) . in viral spike studi ( barnett et al. 2012 ; dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; zhou et al. 2008 ) , they were found to retain viral particl whose surfac is negat charg over a wide rang of ph as their isoelectr point ( pi ) rang most frequent between 3.5 and 7.0 , with a mean valu of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 ( michen and graul 2010 ) . \\n virus are recogn as a major caus of waterrel diseas ( bosch et al. 2008 ; fong and lipp 2005 ; gibson 2014 ; hamza et al. 2011 ) . enter virus , more particular , which are associ primarili with gastrointestin ill ( bosch et al. 2008 ; fong and lipp 2005 ; gibson 2014 ; hamza et al. 2011 ) , are impli in most waterborn viral outbreak ( gibson 2014 ; hamza et al. 2011 ) . all type of water , includ water use for drink ( surfac or ground suppli ) , recreat water ( fresh , marin , and swim pool ) , agricultur water for irrig ( river and groundwat ) and wast water ( sewag or industri effluent ) , have been shown to be potenti vehicl for virus transmiss ( bosch et al. 2008 ) . \\n contamin is most frequent of fecal origin ( bosch et al. 2008 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . although viral level may be high at the contamin sourc , e.g. , concentr rang between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particl per gram of fece are refer to in the literatur ( michen and graul 2010 ) , viral concentr as low as 1 - 10 viral particl per liter may be found in environment water ( julian and schwab 2012 ) . sinc enter virus display high infect ( fong and lipp 2005 ; julian and schwab 2012 ) , such titer may constitut a health risk and should be detect for reliabl surveil of viral pathogen in water . as a consequ , effici concentr method are need to captur virus in large-volum water sampl and releas the retain viral materi in concentr form . most common method are base on filtrat process ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; ikner et al. 2012 ) . in particular , virus adsorptionelut ( viradel ) filter method have been wide implement sinc the 1970s ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ) . briefli , in a viradel method , virus from aqueous sampl are revers adsorb to micropor filter and then elut from the filter in a small liquid volum ( apha , awwa and wef 1998 ) . adsorb filter carri electr charg and virus retent occur via electrostat interact rather than by size exclus . in other word , viradel filter act as depth filter rather than siev . contrari to viral filter that retain virus by a siev mechan to achiev complet viral clearanc , their pore size lie in the micropor rang , which allow the high flow filtrat necessari for virus captur in larg water sampl . posit or negat charg filter can be use in a viradel procedur , among which those made of cellulos materi have been domin over the last few decad . \\n sinc their pi is below the ph of natur water ( i.e. , around neutral ) ( \\n huang et al. ( 2000 ) tabl 5 continu filter type a water natur no. \\n [ 0 test earlier for concentr of virus in water sampl of differ origin ( tabl 4 ) . more recent studi made use of zeta plus tm 1 mds microfilt , howev ( tabl 5 ) . in these work , pure ( e.g. , distil ) , tap , environment or sewag water sampl were seed with vari enter virus that are common waterborn pathogen , i.e. , member of the famili picornavirida ( poliovirus , coxsakievirus , teschovirus ) , adenovirida ( adenovirus ) , calicivirida ( norovirus , calicivirus ) and reovirida ( rotavirus ) ( fong and lipp 2005 ) , or bacteriophag ( enterobacteria phage ) that are consid as altern indic of fecal contamin and as index organ for the presenc of enter virus in water ( goodridg and steiner 2012 ) . natur contamin water contain suffici level of indigen virus , more particular bacteriophag , were also use in addit to spike studi sensu stricto ( tabl 4 ) . follow sampl filtrat , viral particl adsorb to the filter were elut in concentr form use a varieti of elut solut , the most common eluent consist of a slight alkalin ( ph 9.0 - 9.5 ) protein solut ( i.e. , beef extract ) , frequent buffer with glycine-naoh or anoth amino acid solut ( sometim supplement with salt to aid disrupt of electrostat interact between virus and filter ( shield and farrah 1983 ) , a chaotrop agent ( e.g. , urea ) or a surfact ( e.g. , tween 80 ) to affect virus-filt hydrophob interact . elut virus were quantified-us plaqu titer assay , 50 % tissu cultur infecti dose ( tcid 50 ) , quantit realtim pcr ( qpcr ) and reverse-transcript pcr ( rt-qpcr ) ( hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recoveri effici of the filtrat step by compar to input titer . this effici depend on a number of process paramet includ the filter type and filtrat condit ( e.g. , filtrat rate and pressur ) , the elut buffer composit and elut condit , the natur , input titer and titrat method of the test virus-in addit to the water matrix characterist that may affect virus quantif and filter perform ( borchardt et al. 2013 ) . henc , tabl 4 and 5 display a wide rang of recoveri yield . in practic test aim at the detect of naturallyoccur virus in field , large-volum water sampl , the filtrat ( adsorption-elut ) step is usual a primari concentr step which is follow by a secondari one to reach the virus detect threshold , e.g. , organ floccul or peg precipit ( lewi and metcalf 1988 ) . the recoveri yield of such two-step concentr process was evalu in sever studi use seed or natur contamin water sampl ( tabl 4 , 5 ) . as a general rule , the viral loss due to secondari concentr was balanc by a huge increas in concentr factor allow virus detect in water concentr from large-volum sampl , as report by chang et al. ( 1981 ) and raphael et al. ( 1985 ) for indigen enterovirus in wastewat and rotavirus in sewage-pollut surfac water , respect . after determin the optim elut condit for 1 mds disk-adsorb norovirus follow filtrat of spike distil water sampl , lee et al. ( 2011 ) ( tabl 5 ) appli the optim procedur to the detect of norovirus in environment water . they combin adsorpt filtrat use 1 mds cartridg with organ floccul to enrich virus from largevolum surfac ( 200 l ) and ground ( 500 l ) water sampl . this integr two-step process led to high volum reduct factor , i.e. , 10,000 and 25,000 for surfac and ground water sampl , respect ( 200 - 5009 for filtrat , 509 for organ floccul ) , but it recoveri effici was not evalu by spike studi . in the same way , besid spike woo et al. ( 2012 ) . a ratio of the virus surviv factor in the treat filter to that in the untreat filter , where the virus surviv factor in a filter is the number of virus recov by elut from the filter divid by the number of virus remov by the filtrat process . b pf pp filter from commerci surgic mask ( dupont tm 01361n ) , ccf coars pore cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 54 , 22 lm pore size ) , fcf fine pore cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 50 , 2.7 lm pore size ) studi like those detail in tabl 5 , 1 mds filter cartridg have been wide appli to concentr enter virus in water sampl of differ origin ( tabl 6 ) , rang from large-volum sampl of weak contamin water intend for drink or drink water product ( borchardt et al. 2003 ( borchardt et al. , 2004 lee et al. 2014 ; sedmak et al. 2005 ; verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewat sampl with high viral content-to assess the virus remov effici of wastewat treatment plant ( kuo et al. 2010 ; simmon et al. 2011 ) . in these test of field water sampl for enter virus , 1 mds filtrat was main combin with second-stag concentr by organ floccul as detail by fout et al. ( 2001 ) in the usepa ( unit state environment protect agenc ) manual of method for virolog . the elut of filter-adsorb viral particl was most perform with an alkalin beef extract solut supplement or not with glycin ( buffer eb3 and eb1 in tabl 5 ) . the work by verheyen et al. ( 2009 ) is an except to these common procedur . to concentr virus in small-volum sampl from drink water sourc , these author use two filter cartridg in seri with no addit concentr step and an alkalin powder milk solut as elut buffer . they found that 20 % ( 3/15 ) and 13 % ( 32/247 ) of surfac and ground ( well ) water sourc , respect , were contamin with adenovirus , with veri few sampl posit to rotavirus ( 0/15 surfac water sampl , 6/247 well water sourc ) . despit the differ in virus concentr method , these result compar with those obtain by xagoraraki et al. ( 2007 ) and cheong et al. ( 2009 ) for adenovirus detect in surfac ( 14/58 sampl , 24 % ) and ground water ( 4/29 sampl , 14 % ) , respect . they also agre with data report by borchardt et al. ( 2003 ) and cheong et al. ( 2009 ) show the low contamin level of ground water by rotavirus . it is worth note here , howev , that the number of posit sampl report in these viral analys of water ( and the other quot in tabl 6 ) is depend on the sensit of the detect techniqu use to assess the presenc of virus , i.e. , nucleic acid-bas amplif method such as convent pcr , reverse-transcript pcr ( rt-pcr ) , nest pcr , real-tim pcr/rt-pcr or integr cell cultur pcr ( icc/pcr ) to determin virus infect ( fong and lipp 2005 ; hamza et al. 2011 , mattison and bidawid 2009 ; watzing et al. 2006 ) with differ detect threshold . \\n it emerg from this glanc at literatur that cellulose-bas electroposit filter are still common use for viral monitor of water . these filter are expens , howev , and face competit with cheaper product , in particular nanoalumina fiber filter and glass wool filter ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . the former , nanoceram tm filter manufactur by argonid corpor ( sanford , fla. , usa ) , are compos of nanos ( 2 nm diamet ) , alumina-bas { main boehmit , c-alo(oh ) } fibrill dispers in a microglass fiber matrix , result in an electroposit filter media with 2 - 3 lm averag pore size kaledin 2005 , 2006 ) . the latter consist of commerci sodocalc glass wool coat with miner oil ( type bourr 725 qn/tech loos wool , isov saint-gobain , courbevoi , franc ) , hand pack into column or filter holder in the laboratori ( vilagin\\u00e8 et al. 1993 ) . these glass wool filter harbor electroposit site while present hydrophob surfac characterist . effici enrich of ( seed or/ and ) indigen virus from various water sampl use nanoceram ( gibbon et al. 2010 ; ikner et al. 2011 ; pang et al. 2012 ) , and glass wool ( debooser et al. 2011 ; lambertini et al. 2008 ; wyn-jon et al. 2011 ) filter has been report in recent year ( see also cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . compar with 1 mds filter ( tabl 5 ) , nanoceram filter show similar , slight lower ( mcminn 2013 ) or higher ( karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentr effici . \\n commerci avail under differ pore size ( 0.025 - 8.0 lm ) , mix cellulos ester membran filter are negat charg over a wide rang of ph valu , their overal negat charg increas with ph ( kessick and wagner 1978 ) . micropor filter in the 0.1 - 0.45 lm pore size rang have been use for age in laboratori and industri for size-bas filtrat of bacteri particl and cell debri ( surfac filter ) . these and larger pore size filter have been shown to retain enterovirus , howev , despit the much smaller size of viral particl compar to the nomin mean diamet of filter pore ( cliver 1968 ) . the presenc of salt enhanc virus adsorpt to cellulos ester membran , this effect increas with the cation valenc ( i.e. , al 3 ? [ mg 2 ? [ na ? ) ( walli et al. 1972 ) . acidif of the viral suspens also improv virus adsorpt effici , even in the absenc of exogen ad salt ( sobsey et al. 1973 ) . these earli result were later confirm by lukasik et al. ( 2000 ) , who investig the influenc of mono- , di- , and trival salt ( nacl , mgcl 2 , and alcl 3 ) on the adsorpt of poliovirus and enterobacteria phage to the mf-millipor tm membran filter type ha ( 0.45 lm pore size ) and the electroposit 3 m tm zeta plus tm 1 mds microfilt at neutral or acid ph. at ph 7 , salt promot virus adsorpt to ha filter while affect adsorpt to 1 mds filter . at ph 3.5 , more than 95 % of the virus test adsorb to ha filter with or without salt ad to the viral suspension-th salt interf again with viral adsorpt to 1mds filter . furthermor , the addit of urea or tween 80 to the salt solut affect virus adsorpt to both filter at ph 3.5 and ha filter at ph 7 . in agreement with previous studi by the same group ( haramoto et al. 2004 ( haramoto et al. , 2005 lukasik et al. ( 2000 ) explain these result by the antichaotrop effect of salt that increas hydrophob interact between filter and virus and was impair by the chaotrop agent or the deterg . at neutral ph , charg screeen by salt addit reduc electrostat attract and repuls forc between virus and 1 mds or ha filter , respect . cation-medi cross-complex between negat group on virus and filter surfac ( kessick and wagner 1978 ) and , more particular , strengthen hydrophob virusfilt interact contribut to improv the adsorpt effici of ha filter . at acid ph , virus display a posit surfac charg and their electrostat interact with ha filter switch from repuls to attractive-and invers for electroposit 1 mds filter . the presenc of salt probabl affect these interact but was balanc by the promot effect of salt on hydrophob interact . \\n henc , most test report so far for virus concentr from water sampl use cellulos ester filter ( essenti ha filter ) have been perform after addit of multival cation ( main mg 2 ? ) to the water sampl with or without ph adjust to an acid level . accord to katayama et al. ( 2002 ) , the virus-load filter were rins with an acid solut to elimin remain cation befor elut with naoh or other alkalin buffer . haramoto et al. ( 2004 haramoto et al. ( , 2005 haramoto et al. ( , 2007a propos a variat in the method that consist in pre-condit the filter with al 3 ? ion . aluminum chlorid was pass through the filter , make an electroposit ion coat , which avoid cation addit to the water sampl . the recoveri effici of both protocol has been evalu by seed water sampl with enter virus and bacteriophag and quantifi elut virus ( tabl 7 ) . similar to spike studi ( tabl 4 , 5 ) and viral analys of field water sampl ( tabl 6 ) with electroposit filter , the ha-bas filtration/elut process was frequent associ with a secondari concentr step to increas virus concentr factor . here , centrifug ultrafiltr ( cu ) use commerci millipor ( centriprep \\u00f2 , centricon \\u00f2 or amicon \\u00f2 ) concentr was the elect concentr method . these cu unit contain a low adsorpt regener cellulos membran ( ultracel \\u00f2 ) whose nomin molecular-weight cutoff rang between 3 and 100 kda-a mwco valu of 50 kda be most frequent select for secondari concentr of elut virus . they are routin use in laboratori to purifi and concentr biomacromolecul such as peptid , protein , and nucleic acid from small-volum biolog sampl ( e.g. , 2 - 15 ml for the centriprep filter unit ) . test or not for virus recoveri by spike experi , the combin concentr procedur have been extend to the detect of enter virus in field water sampl includ tap ( haramoto et al. 2004 ) , sea ( katayama et al. 2002 ) , river ( surfac ) ( fong et al. 2010 ; hamza et al. 2009 ; haramoto et al. 2005 ) and wast ( fong et al. 2010 ; katayama et al. 2008 ) water ( tabl 8) . sampl with differ volum were collect accord to the water sourc , i.e. , sampl volum increas as the expect contamin level decreas . for instanc , katayama et al. ( 2002 ) appli ha filtrat , follow by acid rins of the filter , viral elut with naoh and secondari concentr of the eluat by cu , to concentr natur occur virus ( norovirus , enterovirus and hav-hepat a virus ) in seawat sampl . base on the volum reduct factor ( 2-l sample/2 ml final concentr , i.e. , 1000 ) and the recoveri yield of the two-step process ( tabl 7 ) , a virus concentr factor of 670 was reach . onli hav virus was not detect in ani sampl test . later on , katayama et al. ( 2008 ) follow the same protocol to concentr enter virus in the raw influent of a wastewat treatment plant . sampl of 100-ml volum were collect and submit to the two-step concentr process , yield a volum reduct factor of c. 140 . the four test kind of enter virus were detect in all 72 wastewat sampl but one lack norovirus gi ( nov gi ) . use peg precipit as the secondari concentr step , hamza et al. ( 2009 ) test river water sampl for contamin by enter virus and bacteriophag . a volum reduct factor of 5000 ( 10-l sample/2 ml final concentr ) and virus concentr factor rang between 1000 ( norovirus ) and 5000 ( adenovirus ) ( see tabl 7 for recoveri yield ) were obtain . all 41 analyz sampl were found posit for enter virus . human adenovirus and norovirus were detect in 97.5 and 32 % of the sampl , respect . haramoto et al. ( 2004 ) illustr the abil of al 3 ? -coat filter to concentr virus from large-volum freshwat sampl without salt addit by detect norovirus in tap water from tokyo univers . tap water sampl ( 303-l averag volum ) underw two success filtration/elut step use 293-mm and 47-mm diamet ha filter prior to concentr by cu ( final volum : 0.9 ml ) , which ensur a volum reduct factor higher than 300,000 . howev , the virus recoveri effici of the 3-step concentr process was not evalu . ten of the 98 test sampl were found posit for norovirus . these result compar to those report by lee et al. ( 2011 ) ( tabl 5 ) use 1 mds cartridg with organ floccul to enrich norovirus from larg surfac and ground water sampl . \\n despit these promis data , the two viradel method base on electroneg filter ( i.e. , addit of mgcl 2 to water sampl or filter coat with al 3 ? ion befor filtrat ) have been essenti implement for viral analysi of water contain high amount of indigen virus , requir limit sampl volum ( tabl 8 ) -electroposit filter cartridg be more adapt to virus concentr from larg volum of weak contamin water ( tabl 6 ) . besid the above-ment work by haramoto et al. ( 2004 ) , onli two studi among those detail in tabl 8 describ virus detect in environment water sampl with low viral content , name drink water sourc after chlorin or without treatment ( rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwat from artesian well ( chironna et al. 2012 ) . both studi use small-volum sampl and cu as secondari concentr step , yield a modest volum reduct factor of 1000 . veri few from 202 artesian well water sampl were found posit to the test enter virus : none for hav and enterovirus , 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus ( chironna et al. 2012 ) . a larg proport ( 50 % ) of sampl from drinkingwat suppli was posit to adenovirus , howev ( rigotto et al. 2010 ) . these data are compat with viral analys of groundwat and water intend for drink perform use 1 mds filtrat as the first virus concentr step ( tabl 6 ) . it should be note , howev , that the same remark appli to data collect in tabl 8 as to those in tabl 6 concern the number of virus-posit sampl , i.e. , their depend on the virus detect method . this can be illustr by the two follow exampl . use icc-pcr ( measur infecti virus ) , katayama et al. ( 2002 ) detect enterovirus in 4 of 6 seawat sampl from bath beach , but no sampl was found posit by direct rt-pcr . de paula et al. ( 2007 ) found 48/52 river water sampl posit for hav by quantit real-tim rt-pcr , but onli 12/52 by nest rt-pcr . \\n as attest by the larg bodi of literatur data quot abov , virus adsorption-elut method use electroposit or electroneg filter are routin appli to the primari concentr of waterborn virus , each type of filter possess it own advantag and drawback . ultrafiltr is consid anoth filtration-bas option to concentr virus from water sampl ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; ikner et al. 2012 ) . it has been indic earlier that cu with microconcentr base on cellulos ultrafiltr disc is common use as a secondari concentr step follow the viradel process . hollow fiber ultrafiltr ( hfuf ) , howev , is consid a potenti techniqu for primari concentr of virus from large-volum water sampl , yield better virus recoveri than the viradel method perform with either electroposit or electroneg filter ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ) . commerci hfuf devic oper in cross-flow mode have been appli to the simultan concentr of biolog particl , includ virus , spike in tap ( polaczyk et al. 2008 ) or reclaim ( liu et al. 2012 ) water sampl , to virus recoveri from seed tap ( rhode et al. 2011 ) and estuarin ( hernandez-morga et al. 2009 ) water sampl , and also , more rare , to virus recoveri from field water sampl ( grassi et al. 2010 ; hernandez-morga et al. 2009 ) . most of these devic are dialyz that contain synthet hf made from polysulfon . follow the earli work by belfort et al. ( 1976 ) show that polysulfon hf membran were superior to cellulos acet one for virus concentr , virus concentr experi use hfuf dialyz equip with hf manufactur from cellulos are scarc . an exampl is given by liu et al. ( 2012 ) . they show that the exeltra plus 210 cellulos triacet hf dialyz ( baxter healthcar corp. , deerfield , il , usa ) and the optiflux \\u00f2 f200nr polysulfon dialyz ( fresenius medic care , walthamm , ma , usa ) provid similar recoveri effici for ms2 and ux174 bacteriophag , escherichia coli , clostridium perfringen spore , and cryptosporidium parvum oocyst from spike 10-l and 100-l sampl of reclaim water . \\n an array of viral infect can be transmit by the airborn rout , in particular via aerosol ( droplet nuclei ) tang et al. 2006 ; tellier 2006 ; verreault et al. 2008 ) . even though virus inactiv rate in the atmospher are general higher than those of bacteri and fungal contamin , virus-contain aerosol can spread worldwid ( despr\\u00e9 et al. 2012 ) . the threat of viral outbreak and pandem such as those caus by sar coronavirus ( yu et al. 2004 ) and high pathogen strain of influenza a virus ( tellier 2006 ) , alli with the fear of bioterror use virus ( e.g. , smallpox and hemorrhag fever virus ) ( barra and greub 2014 ) as biolog weapon , has encourag the search for effici protect equip against aerosol virus-contain particl . \\n individu respiratori protect devic consist in respir , i.e. , air-filt face mask design to protect the wearer against inhal of a hazard atmospher ( here airborn infecti aerosols)-oppos to surgic mask design to protect the environ from contamin generat by the wearer 's exhal breath ( i.e. , prevent of surgic infect ) . current , most '' filter facepiec '' ( ffp ) respir have a multilay composit structur with a central filter layer display electret properti ( gralton and mclaw 2010 ) . these electret filter ( thakur et al. 2013 ) are produc by impart an electrostat charg to a nonwoven fibrous mat compos of synthet polym fiber such as poly(propylen ) ( pp ) ( main ) , poly(butylen terephthal ) , poly(tetrafluoroethylen ) and poly(carbon ) fiber . electrostat charg of the filter media is common obtain by corona discharg , triboelectrif and electrostat spin ( tsai et al. 2002 ) . electret filter collect particl through the combin action of mechan and electrostat forc ( podg\\u00f3rski 2010 ; wang 2001 ( cen 2000 ) should retain respect at least 95 and 94 % of influent particl ( nacl particl are use as nonbiolog surrog particl ) ( rengasami et al. 2009 ) . first worn by surgic team a hundr year ago to prevent bacteri contamin of patient 's open wound , earli surgic mask were construct from layer of cellulos materi , more particular cotton cellulos ( gauz ) ( haller and colwel 1918 ) and deriv ( arnold 1938 ) ( see also belkin 1997 ) . much more recent , face mask made from cotton fabric have been test as altern respiratori protect equip against pandem outbreak such as influenza ( dato et al. 2006 ; davi et al. 2013 ; rengasami et al. 2010 ) . like respir , current commerci avail surgic face mask includ sever layer of non-woven fabric with , frequent , a cellulos inner layer in contact with the wearer 's face to improv wearer 's comfort . howev , the filter layer , usual made of meltblown fiber ( ghosh 2014 ) , is devoid of electret properti . sinc particul filtrat is onli mechan , i.e. , less effici than that of respir , most surgic mask are not certifi for use as respiratori protect devic , standard test to evalu their filtrat efficaci be less stringent ( oberg and brosseau 2008 ) . \\n while a number of studi have confirm that surgic mask logic offer lower protect than respir against aerosol particl , the effect of both type of face mask at prevent viral respiratori infect , in particular influenza , is still a matter of controversi ( bin-reza et al. 2012 ;

METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.\",\n          \"250 words VIRAL ETIOLOGY AND OUTCOME OF SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS AMONG CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO THE PICU ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the viral etiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their clinical significance and prognosis among critically ill children.\\nPatients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded.\\nMain variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded.\\nResults: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV.

Summary This study applied molecular-based method to investigate the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in 59 commercial pig farms in South Korea. The results of RT-PCR screening on a relatively large collection of faeces samples (n = 681) from January 2013 to March 2015 did not reveal the presence of PDCoV until the end of 2014. However, on March 2015, PDCoV-positive samples (SL2, SL5) were detected from SL swine farm in Gyeongbuk province. The phylogenetic trees based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related to the US PDCoV strains rather than those in China. Thought Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) grouped within US PDCoV cluster, the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes suggested that they are different.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 Background On December 31 st , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] .\\nOver the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3] . In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum readiness level [4] . As of April 24, France is the 6 th most severely affected country in the world (in terms of absolute numbers), with approximately 120,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5] . With about 6,000 deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].\\nThe first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 th [7] : in a series of 18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7] [8] [9] [10] .\\nCancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of severe outcome [8, 10] . These retrospective reports, of limited size and restricted to patients hospitalized in Chinese hospitals, may not be fully transposable to Western healthcare systems, as suggested by a preliminary report on New Yorkers admitted to ICU [11] .\\nOur study reports the COVID-19 features and outcomes experienced by inpatients and outpatients actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH) in the Paris area, France.\\nAll rights reserved.

Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19\\nwere hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external intensive care units.\\nSurgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (\\\"plan blanc\\\") required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by learned societies [12] , included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.\\nMedical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national guidelines for breast cancer patients [12] : ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to 75 mg/m 2 . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and everolimus.

Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were systematically reduced by one half and were discontinued whenever possible.\\nRadiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was hypofractionated whenever possible [12, 13] Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the French society of palliative care [14] .\\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms, but subsequently became available to all cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the viral RdRp gene. All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [16, 17] , the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, focal consolidation and linear consolidation. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans. Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [19]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (0: no involvement; 1: \\u226410% of lung volumes; 2: 11-25%; 3: \\u226526% involvement).

Starting from March 13th, 2020, all proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered, as the registry also allowed for clinical follow-up phone calls scheduled at days 8, 14 and 28. More frequent and/or longer follow-up was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also registered and prospectively followed. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 th , 2020. This report was written according to the STROBE checklist.\\nThree populations were considered: patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR (positive RNA test); patients who had a positive RNA test or for whom RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but suggestive radiologic findings (COVID-19 patients); patients with symptoms only. Main outcome of patients were defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor analysis was performed. As a sensitivity analysis, prognostic factor analysis of death only was performed. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.\\nFrom March 13 th , 2020 to April 25 th , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in Figure 1A . RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41 patients) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings (N=18 patients).

Figure 1B .\\nBreast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1 . Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients (17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension (36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).\\nAbout two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing anti-cancer treatments were representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).\\nClinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 2 . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the 59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm 3 ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. The most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities, observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. Figure 2 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease: no significant association was observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19 lung disease.\\nAll patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home.

The flow of COVID-19 patients during the the course disease is shown in Figure 3 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24 th , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nNoteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).\\nFurther details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Supplementary Table 1 .\\nAn exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19 population showed that only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). They remained as prognostic factors in the RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast cancer patients.\\nWhile 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [20]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients, as a whole, are not at high risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This apparent low incidence could possibly be attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been All rights reserved.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.\\nIn terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the subgroup with positive RNA tests. As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.\\nWhile lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus of attention to define patients at high risk.

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.\\nMucosal immunity plays an important role in prevention of invasion by pathogens, which could be induced via systemic or mucosal immunization.\\nHowever, both immunization protocols require an effective adjuvant to produce better immune responses.\\nMucosally delivered antigen in the absence of an adjuvant usually induces either a low or undetectable antigen-specific immune response or results in immune tolerance [7, 43] . At present, a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States or elsewhere. Examples include oral vaccines, which mostly comprise live attenuated antigens, against Poliovirus [29] , V. cholerae, Salmonella typhi [22] , and Rotavirus [14] , and a nasal vaccine against influenza virus [3] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective mucosal adjuvant is a high priority in the development of efficient mucosal vaccine.\\nA synthetic dsRNA, termed Poly(I:C), has been found be able to boost immune responses since the 1960s [10, 45] . Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).\\nPIKA is a particular derivative of Poly (I:C) comprising kanamycin and calcium chloride [25] specific IgG and IFN-\\u03b3 responses in mice [33] . Most recent studies also showed that PIKA can provide broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses and coadministration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic H5N1 subunit vaccine can lead to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvements of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice [18, 19] .\\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of this \\nProduct [24] was inactivated with formaldehyde. PIKA is an improved adjuvant formulation comprising a derivative of Poly(I:C), kanamycin and calcium chloride [23, 33] , which was manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices by NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore.\\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Hubei CDC and maintained in SPF environment throughout the experiment. The mice were immunized through either an intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV or 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV plus the indicated dose of PIKA. Mice immunized with PBS served as a negative control. The protocol for intranasal immunization required the mice to be anesthetized slightly with sodium pentobarbital and held inverted with nose up until droplets of vaccine that were applied to both external nares were completely inhaled [13] . All intranasally immunizing reagents were suspended with PBS. Individual mice received 10 \\u00b5L of inoculants for five times with a 30 min resting interval between inoculations (total volume, 50 \\u00b5L). For intraperitoneal immunization, vaccine compositions were adjusted with PBS to a consistent 200 \\u00b5L dose. Each mouse received three immunizations with a 2-week interval between each immunization.\\nAll samples were collected two weeks after the final immunization as previously described [9] . Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital plexus puncture. Saliva was obtained after intraperitoneal injection with 20\\u00b5g of carbamylcholine chloride. The vaginal tract of individual mice was washed with 30\\u00b5L PBS for three times, with a total volume of 90\\u00b5L. After removing feces, small intestine tissues were weighed, cut into small pieces, mixed with PBS (100 mg of small intestine in 200\\u00b5L of PBS), and rocked at 4\\u2103 for 5 h. For collection of lung washing fluid, the trachea was exposed surgically and the oral portion of trachea was clamped, a 1-mL syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle was inserted into the trachea, 200\\u00b5L of PBS was injected into the peripheral airways, and five cycles of aspiration and injection were repeated [36] . After centrifugation at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min, supernatants of all samples were collected and stored at -80\\u00b0C before antibody detection.\\nThe anti-SARS-CoV titer of each sample was determined by ELISA.

However, no specific sIgA titer could be detected in lung washing fluid (Fig.   3A ) although neutralizing activity could be detected in the lung (Fig. 2D) . One concern was how the the lung \\nWe also assayed the SARS-CoV specific IgG in the pooled mucosal samples as well as in the serum samples\\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 4 .

A parenterally administered viruslike particle even elicited 90% to 100% efficacy against infection and pre-invasive disease in previously uninfected individuals [15] .\\nFor determining correlation between neutralizing activity and antibody in serum and mucosal secretion, both IgG and IgA responses in serum and in mucosal secretion were tested. In our study, neutralizing activity was detected in lung samples from three groups of mice, in which only specific IgG but not IgA could be detected (Fig. 2-4) . Antibody analysis also indicated that it was specific IgG but not specific IgA response at mucosal sites that was correlated with neutralizing activity. It is very possible that mucosal IgG could also play an important role in contributing to the neutralizing activity at mucosal sites. It has been propose [41] , serum IgG induced in parenteral immunization could find its way to the mucosae to exert protective effects. The relatively high concentrations of IgG seen at particular mucosal sites may reflect a combination of constitutive transcellular or paracellular transport from the systemic compartment and specific transport mechanism [41] .\\nTherefore, detection of IgG response in mucosal sites is also useful for evaluation of mucosal immune response and related neutralizing activity.\\nBecause SARS-CoV infection occurs at mucosal surfaces, such as lung, digestive surfaces and even vaginal surface [20, 21, 26, 38, 40] , the induction of a neutralizing activity which could block virus attachment and infection is more important in SARS-CoV prevention. Our study showed that PIKA was effective at inducing neutralizing activity at mucosal sites when co-administered by intraperitoneal and intranasal immunization (Fig. 2) . Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA. This may partially result from certain loss of vaccine antigen, dilution by mucosal secretion, capture by mucus gels, attack by proteases and nucleases, or exclusion by epithelial cells when delivered through mucosal routes [30] .\\nHowever, it should be noted that intranasal immunization could induce much higher specific IgA responses than intraperitoneal immunization. Many studies already demonstrated that mucosal sIgA can inhibit viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular virus neutralization, and transepithelial transport of immune complexes [17, 28, 44] . Even rotavirus VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies that lack neutralizing activity can protect mice against infection by] rotavirus via an intracellular neutralization mechanism [5] . SARS-CoV-specific sIgA may also provide a similar kind of protection against SARS-CoV invasion at mucosal sites in the absence of classical neutralizing activities. If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.\\nThe adjuvanticity of PIKA may be mostly derived from its main component Poly(I:C). However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] . Takeshi [11] .\\nFor development and application of an adjuvant for human use, the priority is its safety. CT is the most potent known mucosal adjuvant, but it has adverse side effects, such as nasal discharge in humans. Here we determined the mucosal adjuvanticity of a new adjuvant, PIKA, which is a derivative of Poly(I:C).\\nPoly(I:C) itself is toxic to human and can be rapidly hydrolyzed despite its strong adjuvanticity [6] . PIKA is an improved adjuvant which was formulated as a [26] . All together, PIKA is well formulated as a stable and safe adjuvant.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of PIKA as an adjuvant can significantly raise the humoral immune response with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV in serum and mucosal sites. Therefore, PIKA is a good adjuvant candidate and can be also used as mucosal vaccine.\",\n          \"Abstract Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review. Virus capture/purification/concentration is critical in a number of biopharmaceutical and clinical applications. Validation of virus clearance is essential in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, in particular blood products (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; de Mendoza et al. 2012; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Shukla et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, large-scale, efficient purification schemes of viruses/ virus-like particles are required for the production of prophylactic vaccines and gene therapy vectors (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2006 Segura et al. , 2011 Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Virus inactivation technologies are commonly used to fulfil viral safety. They include physical (e.g., heat application, ultraviolet-and gamma irradiation) and chemical methods (e.g., solvent/detergent treatments) or their combination (e.g., exposure to photosensitizer plus UV light) (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Klein and Bryant 2009; Pelletier et al. 2006; Prowse 2013; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Solheim 2008) . Common methods for virus capture include filtration (Charcosset 2006; Grein et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) and chromatography in column or membrane configurations (Charcosset 2006; Gottschalk 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2013; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Segura et al. 2011 ). Viral filtration is usually the final purification step in the downstream processing of biopharmaceutical products, e.g., monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 1) , following one or more chromatography ''polishing'' steps that contribute to the overall virus removal efficiency of the process before concentration of the purified product. Filtration technologies are also extensively used for the capture and concentration of waterborne viral pathogens (Gibson 2014 ) from drinking, environmental, recreational or waste water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In addition, particulate air filters are used in personal respiratory protective equipment (i.e., face masks and respirators) Cohen and Birkner 2012; Rengasamy et al. 2004) to ensure shortrange protection of wearers against airborne pathogens-which include a number of viruses (Tang et al. 2006 )-and in air purifiers/cleaners to limit longrange aerosol transmission of infection in healthcare settings (Hyttinen et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2006) .\\nCellulosic membrane microfilters have been used routinely for ages in laboratories to perform the socalled ''sterile filtration'' (cold sterilization), i.e., the absolute removal of bacteria, yeasts and molds but not viruses (Walsh and Denyer 2012) from heat-sensitive liquid media. However, many virus filtration devices currently implemented are made from cellulose and its derivatives. Some eighty years ago, Gradocol, graded collodion (cellulose nitrate) membrane filters (Elford 1931; Bauer and Hughes 1934) have been extensively used in ultrafiltration to estimate the size of several medically important viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease (Galloway and Elford 1931) , vaccinia (Elford and Andrewes 1932) , herpes (Elford et al. 1933) , poliomyelitis (Elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza (Elford et al. 1936 ) (see also Ferry (1936) for an exhaustive review). Later on, commercial mixed cellulose ester filters with very low pore size, namely VF (virus fine), VM (virus medium) and VC (virus coarse) grade filters produced by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA-a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), have also been applied to virus ultrafiltration for grouping by size assessment (Hsiung 1965). As part of a series of papers surveying the antiviral applications of polysaccharide-based materials, the present review focuses on viral filtration using cellulosic filter media-most of which are commercially available products that have been extensively tested over the past twenty years for the removal/concentration/purification of viral particles from liquid samples, i.e., biopharmaceutical (namely blood products) and environmental (raw or treated) water samples. The application of cellulose-based filters in individual respiratory protective devices protecting the wearer against airborne viral pathogens is also detailed. Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for viral clearance or recovery/purification of viruses or virus-like particles will be presented elsewhere.\\nIn the processing of biological products, virus removal from the product stream while providing maximum product recovery is a critical task. It is more particularly difficult to eliminate small viral particles such as parvoviruses, which may contaminate blood products and mammalian cell cultures used in the production of recombinant proteins (Charcosset 2006) . Viral filters developed to answer this challenge are typically membrane (screen) filters ensuring a size-based rejection of viral particles via a sieving mechanism. Given the size of viruses, ranging roughly from 20 (Parvoviridae) to 400 nm (Poxviridae) (Segura et al. 2011) , viral filtration stands between microfiltration and ultrafiltration among pressure-driven filtration processes (Fig. 2) , though it is frequently but incorrectly (van Reis and Zydney 2007) classified as nanofiltration (Burnouf et al. 2005 ).\\n2.1 Regenerated cellulose hollow fiber (HF) membrane filters\\nCommon virus filtration membranes are made from poly(ethersulfone) (PES), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and regenerated cellulose (Burnouf and Radosevich 2003; Carter and Lutz 2002; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) . Among the latter, the commercial Planova TM filters (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) have been widely used to clear viruses from biologically produced pharmaceuticals, in particular blood products. Planova filters are composed of cuprammonium regenerated cellulose HF (Bemberg TM cupro fibers), prepared from cellulose cuprammonium spinning solution via microphase separation under precise spinning conditions (Tsurumi et al. 1990b, c) . The wall of each HF has a threedimensional web structure of pores consisting of large, bulky void pores interconnected by fine capillaries (Tsurumi et al. 1990a, b, c) (Fig. 3 ). During filtration, as the feed solution containing the product of interest is circulated through the HF bore, viruses accumulate in the large, bulky void pores of the fiber network while the product solution passes through the capillary pores. Since the HF wall is several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 4) , viruses are captured gradually inside the porous structure that can be considered multi-layered (100-200 layers) (Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006) . Hence, Planova filters behave like ''membrane depth filters'' (Walsh and Denyer 2012) operating on the basis of size exclusion. They offer a choice of 4 nominal mean pore sizes, namely 15 nm (15N), 19 nm (20N), 35 nm (35N) and 72 nm (75N)-the large pore 75N model being essentially used as a prefilter to remove impurities or aggregates prior to final virus filtration-and can be operated in normal (dead-end/flow through) or tangential flow (cross flow) filtration mode (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Planova filters have emerged to answer a publichealth problem of worldwide magnitude, i.e., blood contamination by HIV (Hamamoto et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1989 ) and hepatitis viruses (Yuasa et al. 1991; Sekiguchi et al. 1989 Sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . Table 1 gives examples of viral clearance studies assessing the capacity of Planova filters to remove viruses from blood products. In these viral clearance assays, product streams resulting from successive, scaleddown purification steps representative of the manufacturing process of the product (Kundu and Reindel 2007) , were artificially contaminated (''spiked'') with model viruses of different sizes (Table 2 ) (at much higher concentrations than what might be commonly found in the product intermediate) before being submitted to filtration. The virus removal efficiency of the filtration step was expressed as LRV (log reduction value, i.e., log ratio of the viral load in the spiked product feed stream to that recovered in the product filtrate), which implies that residual virus infectivity can never be reduced to zero but may be greatly reduced mathematically (ICH 1999) . Minimum LRV values were most frequently given. They were estimated when no viruses could be detected in filtered samples taking into account the detection limit of the assay (viral titer estimated as 1 infectious unit per sample volume). From the measured LRVs, the filtration operation is usually classified as effective (LRV [ 4), moderately effective (1 \\\\ LRV \\\\ 4) or Makino et al. (1994) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) ineffective (LRV \\\\ 1) (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Since filtration complements other viral clearance methods in the downstream processing of biotherapeutics (Brorson 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2007) , several studies quoted in Table 1 also report LRVs for common virus reduction steps such as inactivation by pasteurization (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007) or solvent/detergent treatment (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) , and chromatographic capture (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012) . Virus removal during the plasma fractionation process (Bryant and Klein 2007) leading from the crude plasma pool to the product (immunoglobulin here) stream has also been quantified (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) . Overall virus reduction factors obtained by addition of successive LRVs are given in these works, as illustrated by Table 3. In the virus spiking studies quoted in Table 1 , the actual viral filtration step was preceded by prefiltration to eliminate viral and/or protein aggregates that might be present in the spiked product solution. The presence of aggregated viruses may lead to overestimation of size exclusion effectiveness while contributing with protein aggregates to the fouling of viral filters, which reduces the membrane hydraulic permeability and may affect virus retention (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Pre-filtration was performed on the spikevirus stock suspension (Caballero et al. 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2010 ) on the product intermediate before virus inoculation (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012) , and/or on the virus Furuya et al. (2006) and Terpstra et al. (2006) CPV Canine parvovirus B19 V Gr\\u00f6ner ( and Terpstra et al. (2006 Terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spiked material (Chtourou et al. 2007; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006 Terpstra et al. , 2007 . For pre-filtration of the virus preparation, micro filters with a pore size adapted to the spike virus size, i.e., slightly lower than the virus size, were used to remove cell aggregates but not single viral particles-usual pore sizes ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 lm. Micro filters with 0.1-0.2 lm pore size (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007; , but also 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012 ) and 35N (Chtourou et al. 2007) . Planova viral filters were used to pre-filtrate the spiked product solution. In the latter work, the association in series of 35N and 15N filters led to efficient removal of small viruses such as PPV (Chtourou et al. 2007 ). This was not the case when 35N was used as the main viral filter after pre-filtration with 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) , which confirms previous date showing that the 35 nm pore size was too large to retain the smallest viral particles (Furuya et al. 2006; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006 ). Both 20N (Caballero et al. 2014; Furuya et al. 2006; Gr\\u00f6ner 2014) and 15N (Caballero et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2010; Terpstra et al. 2007; Planova filters and their combination (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012 ) showed effective virus removal over a wide range of viral particle sizes (Table 1) . As a general rule, the removal efficiency of the filters increased with the ratio of pore size to virus size, as illustrated by Gr\\u00f6ner (2014) and Terpstra et al. (2007) . This was also demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2010) by filtrating poliovirus type 1 (a picorvanirus) through Planova filters manufactured with different pore sizes, ranging between 15 (LRV = 6.9) and 35 nm (LRV = 0.2). The two-filter combinations were globally more efficient than single filters at removing small viruses from spiked protein intermediates, though two 15N filters connected in parallel for tangential filtration (Koenderman et al. 2012) yielded LRVs quite similar to those obtained using 15N alone (Terpstra et al. 2006 ). Care should be taken when comparing vertically the data collected in Table 1 , however. In addition to the sizes of viral particles and filter pores, the results of such virus-spiking studies are dependent on a number of process parameters such as the filtration operating conditions (filtration mode, transmembrane pressure, volume per filter area, tempera-ture\\u2026), the characteristics of the product feed stream (pH, conductivity, nature and concentration of the product\\u2026), or else the purity level and concentration of the virus spike. Moreover, several studies include pre-filtration (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) or viral inactivation (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) in the calculation of LRVs. This variability in test conditions for filtration-based virus removal makes difficult any comparison between LRVs collected from multiple sources as in Table 1 , even though some results (Caballero et al. 2014; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2010 ) contradict its influence on filtration performance, underlining the robustness of the filtration process. Also, some variations in virus removal capacity may occur between commercial filter modules owing to their manufacture from different batches of HF, as illustrated by Roberts et al. (2010) for 15N filters.\\nLike membrane microfiltration, depth filtration is widely used as a clarification step in biopharmaceutical purification to ensure removal of cell debris, large aggregates and contaminants from the product stream prior to purification processes such as column/membrane chromatography and viral filtration/inactivation steps (Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Vicente et al. Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Commercially available depth filters currently employed in bioprocessing are composed of cellulose fibers with a porous inorganic filter aid and a resin binder, generally cationic. For instance, the Zeta Plus TM filter media (3 M Purification Inc.-formerly Cuno, Meriden, CT, USA) is composed of a cellulose fiber depth matrix containing silica-based filter-aid material and positively charged by chemical bounding of a cationic charge modifier (Ostreicher 1991) .\\nVarying retention ratings are available (0.1-1.0 lm). The triple layered A1HC filter media from EMD Millipore include two depth filtration layers (cellulose ? diatomaceous earth) of different grades and a 0.1 lm-pore-size microporous membrane pre-filter made of mixed cellulose esters (van Reis and Zydney 2007). Hence, these cellulosic depth filters rely on both size exclusion and electrostatic adsorptive binding to effect separation (Liu et al. 2010) . In viral spiking studies (Barnette et al. 2012; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2008) , they were found to retain viral particles whose surface is negatively charged over a wide range of pH as their isoelectric points (pI) range most frequently between 3.5 and 7.0, with a mean value of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 (Michen and Graule 2010) .\\nViruses are recognized as a major cause of waterrelated disease (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) . Enteric viruses, more particularly, which are associated primarily with gastrointestinal illness (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) , are implied in most waterborne viral outbreaks (Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011 ). All types of water, including waters used for drinking (surface or ground supplies), recreational waters (fresh, marine, and swimming pool), agricultural waters for irrigation (rivers and groundwater) and waste waters (sewage or industrial effluents), have been shown to be potential vehicles for virus transmission (Bosch et al. 2008) .\\nContamination is most frequently of fecal origin (Bosch et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2012) . Although viral levels may be high at the contamination source, e.g., concentrations ranging between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particles per gram of feces are referred to in the literature (Michen and Graule 2010) , viral concentrations as low as 1-10 viral particles per liter may be found in environmental water (Julian and Schwab 2012) . Since enteric viruses display high infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Julian and Schwab 2012) , such titers may constitute a health risk and should be detected for reliable surveillance of viral pathogens in water. As a consequence, efficient concentration methods are needed to capture viruses in large-volume water samples and release the retained viral material in concentrated form. Most common methods are based on filtration processes (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In particular, virus adsorptionelution (viradel) filter methods have been widely implemented since the 1970s (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Briefly, in a viradel method, viruses from aqueous samples are reversibly adsorbed to microporous filters and then eluted from the filters in a small liquid volume (APHA, AWWA and WEF 1998). Adsorbent filters carry electrical charges and virus retention occurs via electrostatic interaction rather than by size exclusion. In other words, viradel filters act as depth filters rather than sieves. Contrary to viral filters that retain viruses by a sieving mechanism to achieve complete viral clearance, their pore size lies in the microporous range, which allows the high flow filtration necessary for virus capture in large water samples. Positively or negatively charged filters can be used in a viradel procedure, among which those made of cellulosic materials have been dominant over the last few decades.\\nSince their pI is below the pH of natural water (i.e., around neutrality) ( \\nHuang et al. (2000) Table 5 continued Filter type a Water nature No.\\n[0 tested earlier for concentration of viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 4 ). More recent studies made use of Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilters, however (Table 5 ). In these works, pure (e.g., distilled), tap, environmental or sewage water samples were seeded with varying enteric viruses that are common waterborne pathogens, i.e., members of the families Picornaviridae (polioviruses, coxsakieviruses, teschoviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses), Caliciviridae (noroviruses, caliciviruses) and Reoviridae (rotaviruses) (Fong and Lipp 2005) , or bacteriophages (enterobacteria phages) that are considered as alternative indicators of fecal contamination and as index organisms for the presence of enteric viruses in waters (Goodridge and Steiner 2012). Naturally contaminated waters containing sufficient levels of indigenous viruses, more particularly bacteriophages, were also used in addition to spiking studies sensu stricto (Table 4) . Following sample filtration, viral particles adsorbed to the filter were eluted in concentrated form using a variety of eluting solutions, the most common eluent consisting of a slightly alkaline (pH 9.0-9.5) protein solution (i.e., beef extract), frequently buffered with glycine-NaOH or another amino acid solution (sometimes supplemented with salt to aid disruption of electrostatic interactions between viruses and filters (Shields and Farrah 1983) , a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea) or a surfactant (e.g., Tween 80) to affect virus-filter hydrophobic interactions . Eluted viruses were quantified-using plaque titer assays, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recovery efficiency of the filtration step by comparing to input titers. This efficiency depends on a number of process parameters including the filter type and filtration conditions (e.g., filtration rate and pressure), the elution buffer composition and eluting conditions, the nature, input titer and titration method of the tested virus-in addition to the water matrix characteristics that may affect virus quantification and filter performance (Borchardt et al. 2013) . Hence, Tables 4 and 5 display a wide range of recovery yields. In practical tests aimed at the detection of naturallyoccurring viruses in field, large-volume water samples, the filtration (adsorption-elution) step is usually a primary concentration step which is followed by a secondary one to reach the virus detection threshold, e.g., organic flocculation or PEG precipitation (Lewis and Metcalf 1988) . The recovery yield of such two-step concentration processes was evaluated in several studies using seeded or naturally contaminated water samples (Tables 4, 5) . As a general rule, the viral loss due to secondary concentration was balanced by a huge increase in concentration factor allowing virus detection in water concentrates from large-volume samples, as reported by Chang et al. (1981) and Raphael et al. (1985) for indigenous enteroviruses in wastewater and rotaviruses in sewage-polluted surface water, respectively. After determining the optimal elution conditions for 1 MDS disk-adsorbed noroviruses following filtration of spiked distilled water samples, Lee et al. (2011) (Table 5 ) applied the optimized procedure to the detection of noroviruses in environmental water. They combined adsorptive filtration using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich viruses from largevolume surface (200 l) and ground (500 l) water samples. This integrated two-step process led to high volume reduction factors, i.e., 10,000 and 25,000 for surface and ground water samples, respectively (200-5009 for filtration, 509 for organic flocculation), but its recovery efficiency was not evaluated by spiking studies. In the same way, beside spiking Woo et al. (2012) . a Ratio of the virus survival factor in the treated filter to that in the untreated filter, where the virus survival factor in a filter is the number of viruses recovered by elution from the filter divided by the number of viruses removed by the filtration process. b PF PP filter from commercial surgical mask (DuPont TM 01361N), CCF coarse pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 54, 22 lm pore size), FCF fine pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50, 2.7 lm pore size) studies like those detailed in Table 5 , 1 MDS filter cartridges have been widely applied to concentrate enteric viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 6) , ranging from large-volume samples of weakly contaminated water intended for drinking or drinking water production (Borchardt et al. 2003 (Borchardt et al. , 2004 Lee et al. 2014; Sedmak et al. 2005; Verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewater samples with high viral content-to assess the virus removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Kuo et al. 2010; Simmons et al. 2011) . In these tests of field water samples for enteric viruses, 1 MDS filtration was mainly combined with second-stage concentration by organic flocculation as detailed by Fout et al. (2001) in the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) manual of methods for virology. The elution of filter-adsorbed viral particles was mostly performed with an alkaline beef extract solution supplemented or not with glycine (buffers EB3 and EB1 in Table 5 ). The work by Verheyen et al. (2009) is an exception to these common procedures. To concentrate viruses in small-volume samples from drinking water sources, these authors used two filter cartridges in series with no additional concentration step and an alkaline powdered milk solution as elution buffer. They found that 20% (3/15) and 13% (32/247) of surface and ground (well) water sources, respectively, were contaminated with adenoviruses, with very few samples positive to rotavirus (0/15 surface water samples, 6/247 well water sources). Despite the differences in virus concentration methods, these results compare with those obtained by Xagoraraki et al. (2007) and Cheong et al. (2009) for adenovirus detection in surface (14/58 samples, 24%) and ground water (4/29 samples, 14%), respectively. They also agree with data reported by Borchardt et al. (2003) and Cheong et al. (2009) showing the low contamination level of ground water by rotavirus. It is worth noting here, however, that the number of positive samples reported in these viral analyses of water (and the others quoted in Table 6 ) is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection techniques used to assess the presence of viruses, i.e., nucleic acid-based amplification methods such as conventional PCR, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR/RT-PCR or integrated cell culture PCR (ICC/PCR) to determine virus infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Hamza et al. 2011, Mattison and Bidawid 2009; Watzinger et al. 2006) with different detection thresholds.\\nIt emerges from this glance at literature that cellulose-based electropositive filters are still commonly used for viral monitoring of water. These filters are expensive, however, and face competition with cheaper products, in particular nanoalumina fiber filters and glass wool filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . The former, NanoCeram TM filters manufactured by Argonide Corporation (Sanford, Fla., USA), are composed of nanosized (2 nm diameter), alumina-based {mainly boehmite, c-AlO(OH)} fibrilles dispersed in a microglass fiber matrix, resulting in an electropositive filter media with 2-3 lm average pore size Kaledin 2005, 2006) . The latter consist of commercial sodocalcic glass wool coated with mineral oil (type Bourre 725 QN/TECH Loose Wool, Isover Saint-Gobain, Courbevois, France), hand packed into columns or filter holders in the laboratory (Vilagin\\u00e8s et al. 1993) . These glass wool filters harbor electropositive sites while presenting hydrophobic surface characteristics. Efficient enrichment of (seeded or/ and) indigenous viruses from various water samples using NanoCeram (Gibbons et al. 2010; Ikner et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2012) , and glass wool (Deboosere et al. 2011; Lambertini et al. 2008; Wyn-Jones et al. 2011 ) filters has been reported in recent years (see also Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . Compared with 1 MDS filters (Table 5) , NanoCeram filters showed similar , slightly lower (McMinn 2013) or higher (Karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentration efficiency.\\nCommercially available under different pore sizes (0.025-8.0 lm), mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are negatively charged over a wide range of pH values, their overall negative charge increasing with pH (Kessick and Wagner 1978) . Microporous filters in the 0.1-0.45 lm pore size range have been used for ages in laboratory and industry for size-based filtration of bacterial particles and cell debris (surface filters). These and larger pore size filters have been shown to retain enteroviruses, however, despite the much smaller size of viral particles compared to the nominal mean diameter of filter pores (Cliver 1968 ). The presence of salts enhanced virus adsorption to cellulose ester membranes, this effect increasing with the cation valence (i.e., Al 3? [ Mg 2? [ Na ? ) (Wallis et al. 1972) . Acidification of the viral suspension also improved virus adsorption efficiency, even in the absence of exogenously added salts (Sobsey et al. 1973 ). These early results were later confirmed by Lukasik et al. (2000) , who investigated the influence of mono-, di-, and trivalent salts (NaCl, MgCl 2 , and AlCl 3 ) on the adsorption of poliovirus and enterobacteria phages to the MF-Millipore TM membrane filter type HA (0.45 lm pore size) and the electropositive 3M TM Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilter at neutral or acidic pH. At pH 7, salts promoted virus adsorption to HA filter while affecting adsorption to 1 MDS filter. At pH 3.5, more than 95% of the viruses tested adsorbed to HA filter with or without salt added to the viral suspension-the salts interfering again with viral adsorption to 1MDS filter. Furthermore, the addition of urea or Tween 80 to the salt solution affected virus adsorption to both filters at pH 3.5 and HA filter at pH 7. In agreement with previous studies by the same group (Haramoto et al. 2004 (Haramoto et al. , 2005 Lukasik et al. (2000) explained these results by the antichaotropic effect of salts that increased hydrophobic interactions between filters and viruses and was impaired by the chaotropic agent or the detergent. At neutral pH, charge screeening by salt addition reduced electrostatic attractive and repulsive forces between viruses and 1 MDS or HA filter, respectively. Cation-mediated cross-complexation between negative groups on virus and filter surfaces (Kessick and Wagner 1978) and, more particularly, strengthened hydrophobic virusfilter interactions contributed to improving the adsorption efficiency of HA filter. At acidic pH, viruses displayed a positive surface charge and their electrostatic interactions with HA filter switched from repulsive to attractive-and inversely for electropositive 1 MDS filter. The presence of salt probably affected these interactions but was balanced by the promoting effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions.\\nHence, most tests reported so far for virus concentration from water samples using cellulose ester filters (essentially HA filters) have been performed after addition of multivalent cations (mainly Mg 2? ) to the water samples with or without pH adjustment to an acidic level. According to Katayama et al. (2002) , the virus-loaded filters were rinsed with an acidic solution to eliminate remaining cations before elution with NaOH or other alkaline buffers. Haramoto et al. (2004 Haramoto et al. ( , 2005 Haramoto et al. ( , 2007a proposed a variation in the method that consisted in pre-conditioning the filter with Al 3? ions. Aluminum chloride was passed through the filter, making an electropositive ion coating, which avoided cation addition to the water sample. The recovery efficiency of both protocols has been evaluated by seeding water samples with enteric viruses and bacteriophages and quantifying eluted viruses (Table 7) . Similarly to spiking studies (Tables 4, 5) and viral analyses of field water samples (Table 6 ) with electropositive filters, the HA-based filtration/elution process was frequently associated with a secondary concentration step to increase virus concentration factors. Here, centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) using commercial Millipore (Centriprep \\u00d2 , Centricon \\u00d2 or Amicon \\u00d2 ) concentrators was the elective concentration method. These CU units contain a low adsorptive regenerated cellulose membrane (Ultracel \\u00d2 ) whose nominal molecular-weight cutoff ranges between 3 and 100 kDa-a MWCO value of 50 kDa being most frequently selected for secondary concentration of eluted viruses. They are routinely used in laboratories to purify and concentrate biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids from small-volume biological samples (e.g., 2-15 ml for the Centriprep filter unit). Tested or not for virus recovery by spiking experiments, the combined concentration procedures have been extended to the detection of enteric viruses in field water samples including tap (Haramoto et al. 2004 ), sea (Katayama et al. 2002) , river (surface) (Fong et al. 2010; Hamza et al. 2009; Haramoto et al. 2005 ) and waste (Fong et al. 2010; Katayama et al. 2008 ) water (Table 8) . Samples with different volumes were collected according to the water source, i.e., sample volumes increased as the expected contamination level decreased. For instance, Katayama et al. (2002) applied HA filtration, followed by acid rinse of the filter, viral elution with NaOH and secondary concentration of the eluate by CU, to concentrate naturally occurring viruses (noroviruses, enteroviruses and HAV-hepatitis A virus) in seawater samples. Based on the volume reduction factor (2-l sample/2 ml final concentrate, i.e., 1000) and the recovery yield of the two-step process (Table 7) , a virus concentration factor of 670 was reached. Only HAV virus was not detected in any sample tested. Later on, Katayama et al. (2008) followed the same protocol to concentrate enteric viruses in the raw influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Samples of 100-ml volume were collected and submitted to the two-step concentration process, yielding a volume reduction factor of c. 140. The four tested kinds of enteric viruses were detected in all 72 wastewater samples but one lacking norovirus GI (NoV GI). Using PEG precipitation as the secondary concentration step, Hamza et al. (2009) tested river water samples for contamination by enteric viruses and bacteriophages. A volume reduction factor of 5000 (10-l sample/2 ml final concentrate) and virus concentration factors ranging between 1000 (norovirus) and 5000 (adenovirus) (see Table 7 for recovery yields) were obtained. All 41 analyzed samples were found positive for enteric viruses. Human adenovirus and norovirus were detected in 97.5 and 32% of the samples, respectively. Haramoto et al. (2004) illustrated the ability of Al 3? -coated filters to concentrate viruses from large-volume freshwater samples without salt addition by detecting noroviruses in tap water from Tokyo University. Tap water samples (303-l average volume) underwent two successive filtration/elution steps using 293-mm and 47-mm diameter HA filters prior to concentration by CU (final volume: 0.9 ml), which ensured a volume reduction factor higher than 300,000. However, the virus recovery efficiency of the 3-step concentration process was not evaluated. Ten of the 98 tested samples were found positive for noroviruses. These results compare to those reported by Lee et al. (2011) ( Table 5 ) using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich noroviruses from large surface and ground water samples.\\nDespite these promising data, the two viradel methods based on electronegative filters (i.e., addition of MgCl 2 to water samples or filter coating with Al 3? ions before filtration) have been essentially implemented for viral analysis of waters containing high amounts of indigenous viruses, requiring limited sample volumes (Table 8 )-electropositive filter cartridges being more adapted to virus concentration from large volumes of weakly contaminated water (Table 6 ). Beside the above-mentioned work by Haramoto et al. (2004) , only two studies among those detailed in Table 8 describe virus detection in environmental water samples with low viral content, namely drinking water sources after chlorination or without treatment (Rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwater from artesian wells (Chironna et al. 2012) . Both studies used small-volume samples and CU as secondary concentration step, yielding a modest volume reduction factor of 1000. Very few from 202 artesian well water samples were found positive to the tested enteric viruses: none for HAV and enterovirus, 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus (Chironna et al. 2012) . A large proportion (50%) of samples from drinkingwater supplies was positive to adenovirus, however (Rigotto et al. 2010) . These data are compatible with viral analyses of groundwater and water intended for drinking performed using 1 MDS filtration as the first virus concentration step (Table 6 ). It should be noted, however, that the same remark applies to data collected in Table 8 as to those in Table 6 concerning the numbers of virus-positive samples, i.e., their dependence on the virus detection method. This can be illustrated by the two following examples. Using ICC-PCR (measuring infectious viruses), Katayama et al. (2002) detected enteroviruses in 4 of 6 seawater samples from bathing beach, but no sample was found positive by direct RT-PCR. De Paula et al. (2007) found 48/52 river water samples positive for HAV by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, but only 12/52 by nested RT-PCR.\\nAs attested by the large body of literature data quoted above, virus adsorption-elution methods using electropositive or electronegative filters are routinely applied to the primary concentration of waterborne viruses, each type of filter possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. Ultrafiltration is considered another filtration-based option to concentrate viruses from water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). It has been indicated earlier that CU with microconcentrators based on cellulose ultrafiltration discs is commonly used as a secondary concentration step following the viradel process. Hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), however, is considered a potential technique for primary concentration of viruses from large-volume water samples, yielding better virus recoveries than the viradel method performed with either electropositive or electronegative filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Commercial HFUF devices operated in cross-flow mode have been applied to the simultaneous concentration of biological particles, including viruses, spiked in tap (Polaczyk et al. 2008) or reclaimed (Liu et al. 2012) water samples, to virus recovery from seeded tap (Rhodes et al. 2011 ) and estuarine (Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ) water samples, and also, more rarely, to virus recovery from field water samples (Grassi et al. 2010; Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ). Most of these devices are dialyzers that contain synthetic HF made from polysulfone. Following the early work by Belfort et al. (1976) showing that polysulfone HF membranes were superior to cellulose acetate ones for virus concentration, virus concentration experiments using HFUF dialyzers equipped with HF manufactured from cellulose are scarce. An example is given by Liu et al. (2012) . They showed that the Exeltra Plus 210 cellulose triacetate HF dialyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) and the Optiflux \\u00d2 F200NR polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Walthamm, MA, USA) provided similar recovery efficiencies for MS2 and UX174 bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from spiked 10-l and 100-l samples of reclaimed water.\\nAn array of viral infections can be transmitted by the airborne route, in particular via aerosols (droplet nuclei) Tang et al. 2006; Tellier 2006; Verreault et al. 2008 ). Even though virus inactivation rates in the atmosphere are generally higher than those of bacterial and fungal contaminants, virus-containing aerosols can spread worldwide (Despr\\u00e9s et al. 2012) . The threat of viral outbreaks and pandemics such as those caused by SARS coronavirus (Yu et al. 2004 ) and highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus (Tellier 2006) , allied with the fear of bioterrorism using viruses (e.g., smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses) (Barras and Greub 2014) as biological weapons, has encouraged the search for efficient protection equipment against aerosolized virus-containing particles.\\nIndividual respiratory protective devices consist in respirators, i.e., air-filtering face masks designed to protect the wearer against inhalation of a hazardous atmosphere (here airborne infectious aerosols)-opposing to surgical masks designed to protect the environment from contaminants generated by the wearer's exhaled breath (i.e., prevention of surgical infections) . Currently, most ''filtering facepiece'' (FFP) respirators have a multilayer composite structure with a central filtering layer displaying electret properties (Gralton and McLaws 2010) . These electret filters (Thakur et al. 2013) are produced by imparting an electrostatic charge to a nonwoven fibrous mat composed of synthetic polymer fibers such as poly(propylene) (PP) (mainly), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(carbonate) fibers. Electrostatic charging of the filter media is commonly obtained by corona discharge, triboelectrification and electrostatic spinning (Tsai et al. 2002) . Electret filters collect particles through the combined action of mechanical and electrostatic forces (Podg\\u00f3rski 2010; Wang 2001 (CEN 2000) should retain respectively at least 95 and 94% of influent particles (NaCl particles are used as nonbiological surrogate particles) (Rengasamy et al. 2009 ). First worn by surgical teams a hundred years ago to prevent bacterial contamination of patient's open wounds, early surgical masks were constructed from layers of cellulose materials, more particularly cotton cellulose (gauze) (Haller and Colwell 1918) and derivatives (Arnold 1938 ) (see also Belkin 1997) . Much more recently, face masks made from cotton fabrics have been tested as alternative respiratory protective equipment against pandemic outbreaks such as influenza (Dato et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2013; Rengasamy et al. 2010) . Like respirators, current commercially available surgical face masks include several layers of non-woven fabrics with, frequently, a cellulose inner layer in contact with the wearer's face to improve wearer's comfort. However, the filtering layer, usually made of meltblown fibers (Ghosh 2014) , is devoid of electret properties. Since particulate filtration is only mechanical, i.e., less efficient than that of respirators, most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices, standard tests to evaluate their filtration efficacy being less stringent (Oberg and Brosseau 2008) .\\nWhile a number of studies have confirmed that surgical masks logically offer lower protection than respirators against aerosol particles, the effectiveness of both types of face masks at preventing viral respiratory infection, in particular influenza, is still a matter of controversy (Bin-Reza et al. 2012; Cowling et al. 2010; Gralton and McLaws 2010) . The improper facial fit of respirators Coia et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protection efficiency against infectious aerosols. It allows particulate flows outside the filtration area of the mask, resulting in face-seal leaks, i.e., the leakage of infectious particles around the edges of the mask (Grinshpun et al. 2009; Lei et al. 2013) . Mask seal leakage can be minimized by applying existing guidelines for correct donning and fit checking of respirators . Moreover, human face and head form models have been proposed as a tool for designing respirators with improved protection efficiency, simulating interactions between faces and facemasks and describing their fit (Golshahi et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2012) . The accumulation of viral particles at the surface and within the filtration media of respirators, where they can remain viable and infectious for extended periods of time (Coulliette et al. 2013; Sakaguchi et al. 2010) , is another significant problem with which respirator wearers are confronted in the prevention of viral transmission and spread. Incorrect mask handling by the wearer may lead to accidental self-inoculation, cross-contaminations affecting both other healthcare workers and patients, and contamination of fomites (Casanova et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the risk of virus reaerosolization from respirators during extended use, if limited, cannot be ruled out (Fisher et al. 2012) . Recommendations for respirator doffing do exist but have proven insufficient to prevent virus transfer from respirator to healthcare employees' hands and clothing (Casanova et al. 2008) . Adding antiviral properties to the filtration process may contribute to limit the risk of viral transmission by improper handling of used respirators. A number of virucidal facemasks have been developed and patented over the past 15 years (Tiliket et al. 2011) , some of which are commercially available. In the SpectraShield TM Plus respirator masks designed by Nexera Medical Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) (Haas 2008), for instance, two layers of filter media are sandwiched between (inner and outer) antimicrobial layers where a silver-copper zeolite (carrier) antimicrobial agent (Agion \\u00d2 antimicrobial, Sciessent LLC, Wakefield, Mass.) is embedded around the core of synthetic fibers (Fosshield \\u00d2 , Foss Manufacturing, Hampton, NH). The Biofriend TM Biomask TM FFP respirator, manufactured by Filligent Ltd. (Hong Kong) and distributed by Medline Industries, Inc. (Mundelein, Ill.) , is another four-layered device in which the melt-blown PP filtration layer is inserted between an inner layer of spunbond PP and two antiviral layers, namely a cellulose/polyester layer containing copper and zinc ions and an outer layer of spunbond PP treated with a low pH (citric acidacidified) hydrophilic plastic coating (Davison 2012; Stewart et al. 2014) . The outer layer absorbs infectious aerosol droplets and viruses are denaturated by exposure to citric acid. In the second layer, inactivation of viruses with damaged structures is completed by the virucidal effect of divalent metal cations. Contributing to the overall antiviral efficiency of the structure, the cellulosic component of this layer is a sulphated or sulfonated rayon fabric (Stewart et al. 2012 (Stewart et al. , 2014 to which a variety of viral human pathogens bind via the cationic sites of viral envelopes/capsids.\\nBeside the commercial Biomask TM respirator, various composite structures designed for filtrationinactivation of airborne microbial contaminants, where cellulosic materials play an active antimicrobial role, have been patented in recent years Bernard 2006; Nakamura and Nakamura 2011; Tsutsumi 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhong 2011) . Several of them are based on bacterial cellulose layers/coatings provided with an antimicrobial component, i.e., silver (Zhong 2011) or zeolite-supported silver (Nakamura and Nakamura 2011) nanoparticles, and chitosan (Zhang et al. 2012) . The respiratory protective mask described by Zhong (2011) comprises a three-layer bacterial cellulose membrane whose middle layer contains silver nanoparticles. The antimicrobial facemask invented by Nakamura and Nakamura (2011) includes two base cloth elements both of which are made of a woven textile (gauze), a nonwoven cellulose fabric (e.g., rayon), or a porous sheet (e.g., a 0.3-0.5 mm sliced sheet of urethane sponge). The first base cloth is filled with bacterial cellulose nanofibers that retain silver zeolite and a humectant (e.g., trehalose or 1,3-butylene glycol) in their network structure. Additional antimicrobial properties are provided to the mask by impregnating the second base cloth with a carboxylic acid (e.g., citric acid). Zhang et al. (2012) also used bacterial cellulose in a composite antimicrobial material suitable for respiratory protective masks. A nonwoven polymer fabric Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) 16:455-489 479 was coated with a film of bacterial cellulose mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improve the film-forming properties, mechanical strength and air permeability of the coating-and chitosan, a non-sulfated polysaccharide produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin that displays strong antibacterial potency (Kong et al. 2010; Rabea et al. 2003 ) and, to a lesser extent, antiviral activity (Rabea et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2012 ).\\nIn the antimicrobial air filtration device proposed by Bernard (2006) , cellulose derivatives-more particularly, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common pharmaceutical excipient for enteric coating of tablets and capsules with antiviral activity (Pirrone et al. 2011 )-were used as ''biocidal prophylactic compounds'' to provide the classical filter media (e.g., a nonwoven PP web, electrostatically charged or not) with antimicrobial properties. Cellulose derivatives could be incorporated as fibers or particles (micronized fibers) into the air filtration device either in a separate layer positioned before or after the filter media, or deposited onto the outer surface of the filter media relative to the air flow direction. To illustrate this invention, handsheets prepared from CAP fibers intermixed or not with CAP particles were successfully tested for virucidal efficacy by exposure to an aerosol challenge of enterobacteria phage \\u00d8X174.\\nBy exploiting the antimicrobial properties of dialdehyde polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose dialdehydes, Baney et al. (2012) proposed a new method for producing low-cost virucidal filters suitable for respiratory protective masks. The treatment of a standard cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50 filter paper) with sodium periodate improved its antiviral potency due to oxidation of some cellulose to dialdehyde cellulose inside the filter. Challenged with aerosols of MS2 enterobacteria phage at high relative humidity (90% at 23\\u00b0C), the treated filter showed higher filtration efficiency than a control, untreated one, i.e., better removal of viable viral particles (Plaque Forming Units) joined to a lower resistance to air flow (pressure drop)-due to increased pore size distribution (Woo et al. 2011) . Higher inactivation of MS2 virus by the treated filter was also highlighted, confirming an improvement of its disinfection capability (Woo et al. 2011 ). However, the filtration and inactivation of airborne viruses were less effective at lower moisture content of the filter, i.e., at air humidity levels commonly encountered in hospital settings, in particular operating rooms (Balaras et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, the inhalation resistance of the treated filter remained too high for application to respiratory protective masks. The same pros and cons apply to cellulose paper filters treated by immersion into aqueous suspensions of dialdehyde starch (DAS) (Woo et al. 2012) . While this treatment did not affect the removal efficiency of viable MS2 viruses from aerosols at high relative humidity, virus survival on the treated filters was reduced (Fig. 5 ) and the pressure drop decreased as DAS concentration increased. The drop in air flow resistance remained insufficient for practical application to respirators. DAS treatment of a PP filter from a commercial FFP mask did not modify the filtration parameters (virus removal efficiency and pressure drop) of the filter but significantly improved its biocidal efficacy (Fig. 5 )-an opening of this treatment towards the development of virucidal facemasks. Another example of cellulose filter material treated with cellulose derivatives to yield antiviral properties is given by Tsurumi (Tsutsumi 2009 ). This inventor devised a low-cost virucidal mask filter made of a standard cellulose nonwoven fabric impregnated with water extracts of sulfonated or aminated styrenegraft cellulose. To reinforce the water retention properties of the filter media, a superabsorbent resin such as poly(acrylic acid) was added to the graft cellulose extract before impregnation of the fabric or incorporated into a separate layer covering the impregnated fabric. Low (hydrogen ions from sulfonic acid groups) or high (hydroxyl ions generated by aminated groups) pH conditions inside the hydrated material were claimed to make it virucidal against influenza A virus and caliciviruses. The patent gives no illustration of such antiviral properties, however.\\nStudies published by Tiliket et al. (2011) and Catel-Ferreira et al. (2015) present another type of cellulosebased material for airborne virus filtration in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulose material, i.e., commercial Kimwipes \\u00d2 (KW) wipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., Dallas, Tex.), was chemically modified by coating with a synthetic polymer, i.e., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Tiliket et al. 2011) or grafting of an antiviral agent, i.e., catechin (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) . The filtration efficiency of the modified filter media was first tested on aerosolized T4D viruses (Enterobacteria phage T4, Doermann's strain T4D). Then the treated filter was inserted inside a commercial medical mask in place of its cellulosic layer (Kolmi M24001 mask, Kolmi-Hopen, Saint-Barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'Anjou, France), and the reconstructed mask was challenged with TD4 aerosols to evaluate its virus removal efficiency. Both treatments significantly improved the virus capture factor (ratio of upstream to downstream PFU contents) of KW cellulose wipes and of reconstructed commercial masks compared to original masks and to masks reconstructed with untreated wipes. In these studies, the breathability of reconstructed masks was not quantified, nor was the virus survivability on the modified filter media. However, additional filtration experiments using aerosols of influenza A virus (low pathogenic H5N2 strain) showed that challenged viral particles accumulated in PEI functionalized KW layers with no loss in number and infectivity (Tiliket et al. 2011) . Thus these modified masks showed no virucidal effect, the PEImodified layers behaving like an electret media owing to the polycationic character of PEI. On the other hand, since catechin and catechin-grafted wipes showed antiviral activity against T4D viruses in liquid media (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) , it may be assumed that part of viruses accumulated in excess in the treated wipes were inactivated by the polyphenol agent, i.e., the reconstructed masks were actually virucidal.\\nDespite these few examples, the use of cellulosic media in filtration devices aimed at the capture of airborne viral particles remains now very limited compared to filtration of virus-contaminated liquid samples. While patented, several cellulose-based, virucidal filter media designed for insertion in air filtering face masks have not been commercially developed yet.\\nBesides the wearing of personal respiratory protective equipment, another aspect of the fight against airborne infections lies in the decontamination of indoor air in healthcare facilities, and, more generally, of air processed through heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the built environment. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are the primary technology used for particulate removal in these collective protection devices-allied with UV irradiation, ozonation or air ionization to yield indoor air decontamination (Bolashikov and Melikov 2009; Jacob et al. 2013 )-and may be complemented with a photytocatalyst such as TiO 2 to improve the inactivation of accumulated microorganisms Pigeot-Remy et al. 2014 ). Since HEPA filters are essentially made of glass fibers, they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retentive properties will not be detailed further.\\nMost frequently associated with other virus reduction (virus clearance of biopharmaceuticals) or concentration (viral analysis of water) steps, size-exclusion and/ or adsorptive (charge mediated) filtration is an essential tool to fight against viral contaminants in aqueous media. Owing to inherent properties of cellulose, including mechanical strength and hydrophilicity (that opposes protein adsorption and biofouling), allied with widespread availability and biocompatibility, cellulose-based materials are still widely present in viral filters. Developed commercially over the past thirty years, several cellulosic filter media have been and continue to be used for both routine analyses in laboratories and academic research studies aimed at improving the filtration performance, generating a wealth of data quantifying the efficiency of virus removal or recovery/concentration from biologic or water samples, respectively.\\nAs concerns biopharmaceutical compounds, these data arise from validation studies of the filtration step performed by spiking intermediate biologic solutions (mostly blood proteins) from multistage purification processes with known titers of viral particles. Regenerated cellulose HF Planova filters N15-N35, operated in the dead-end mode as a single filter or two units in series, were shown to provide LRV values ranging between 4 and 7, on the average. Increasingly tested since their launching in 1989, these cellulosic filters compete with filter media made of synthetic polymers such as PVDF (e.g., Viresolve \\u00d2 NFP-Normal Flow Parvovirus-from EMD Millipore; Ultipor \\u00d2 VF Grade DV20/DV50 from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) or PES (e.g., Millipore Viresolve \\u00d2 Pro; Virosart \\u00d2 HS/HC/CPV from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). The hydrophilic nature of cellulose fibers is a definite advantage of Planova filters over others for virus removal from protein solutions, minimizing flux decline due to proteindominated filter plugging (cake formation) at constant pressure (normal-flow) filtration (Rathore et al. 2014 ). However, they are usually operated at lower flow rate than filters made of synthetic polymers whose operating pressure is higher. Hydrophilic modified PVDF membrane filters designed for virus removal from high-concentration protein solutions at high flow rate are being developed by several manufacturers, including Asahi-Kasei (i.e., Planova TM BioEX filters, launched in 2009).\\nMany studies have also been reported to assess the virus concentration efficiency of the viradel method using spiked water samples, prior to the detection of waterborne viral contaminants in field water samples. In this method, cellulosic filters, whether positively or negatively charged, are used for adsorptive capture of viruses before virus recovery by elution with a lowvolume eluent. Electropositive filters are more particularly suitable for virus capture in low-contaminated, high-volume water samples, e.g., samples of groundwater or source water for drinking water production ( Table 6) . Though routinely used, these filters are expensive and face competition with nanoalumina fiber filters (e.g., the patented Ahlstrom Disruptor \\u00d2 electroadsorptive filter) (Levi 2011 ) and glass wool filters, which are cheaper. On the other hand, efficient virus adsorption by electronegative filters-the standard, cost-effective mixed cellulose ester membrane microfilters-requires impractical sample pre-treatment: their use is limited to viral analysis of highlycontaminated waters, for which small-volume samples are sufficient (Table 8) .\\nCellulose nanomaterials may represent a promising perspective for cellulosic materials in their application to viral filtration of liquid samples, yielding filtration membranes with higher mechanical strength, water permeability, surface hydrophilicicy and resistance to biofouling (Carpenter et al. 2015) . Ma et al. (2011) have presented a composite membrane consisting of an electrospun poly(acrylonitrile) nanofibrous scaffold deposited on a non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) support. This two-layered membrane was coated by a layer of cellulose nanofibers and tested for retention of MS-2 phages. At acidic pH, phage particles were adsorbed by the negatively charged cellulose nanofiber coating, yielding a LRV value [3.7. Later on, the same nanofibrous composite membrane was doped with cellulose nanofibers functionalized by grafting with poly(vinylamine) . MS-2 phages were adsorbed at neutral pH onto positively charged amino-modified nanofibers, with a LRV value of 4. Metreveli et al. (2014) and Asper et al. (2015) have presented a size-exclusionbased filter paper made of pure cellulose nanofibers for removal of swine influenza A and murine leukemia viruses, respectively. These non-woven materials could be tailored to ensure efficient virus retention (Gustafsson and Mihranyan 2016a). Self assembled into nanosheets to yield ''mille feuille'' structures, they showed efficient removal of parvoviruses (Gustafsson et al. 2016b) : maybe a new filtration media for viral clearance?\\nA number of air filtration devices designed for individual protection against airborne viruses also include cellulosic materials. While published data on the filtration performance of cellulosic media for removal of viruses from air are scarce, industrial research is more apparent, in particular in Asian countries (China, Japan) where airborne pollution is a matter of great concern-the main objective being to add virucidal properties to the filtration media so as to inactivate accumulated viral particles. Therefore, some innovative media have been patented over the past few years with, however, no commercial development to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1405,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Radoshevich, Lilliana.

contribut to further reduc the risk of sars-cov-2 infect . a limit of our studi is that some patient may have been treat by their famili physician or refer to local hospit , without ani notif to ich . rate of high bmi and hypertens in our covid-19 patient cohort were veri similar to those report in a recent prospect large-scal report on french breast cancer patient [ 21 ] , suggest that these comorbid do not increas the risk of covid-19 . our analys show that breast cancer patient have similar clinic and radiolog featur of covid-19 to those previous describ in other report on non-canc covid-19 patient . import , we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a histori of breast and lymph node radiat therapi , radiat therapi sequela and radiolog extent of diseas or outcom . \\n in term of covid-19 outcom , we observ a non-neglig mortal rate of 6.7 % ( 4/59 ) among breast cancer patient diagnos with covid-19 , with a higher mortal rate of 9.7 % ( 4/41 ) in the subgroup with posit rna test . as of april 26 th , the report mortal rate among rna-posit patient in the general popul rang from 18.2 % in franc to 5.6 % in the usa and 3.7 % in germani [ 4 ] . howev , these percentag reflect more test polici more than true differ in mortal rate . as in the general popul , the true infect and mortal rate could subsequ be determin by serolog test detect an immun respons to sars-cov-2 . nevertheless , on univari analysi , age and hypertens were associ with diseas sever rather than the extent of diseas or ongo cancer therapi , suggest that breast cancer patient share the same risk factor for sever covid-19 as the general popul . strike , the onli earli breast cancer patient who die was concomit treat for a system diseas by a ctla-4 signal modul , suggest that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to covid-19 mortal . \\n while lockdown lift procedur are be discuss in most western countri , this first report on breast cancer patient suggest that comorbid

and interperiton respect . howev , no specif siga titer could be detect in lung wash fluid ( fig.    3a ) although neutral activ could be detect in the lung ( fig. 2d ) . one concern was how the the lung \\n we also assay the sars-cov specif igg in the pool mucos sampl as well as in the serum sampl \\n the result are summar in fig. 4 . pika could increas a specif igg respons in intestin , saliva , vagina and lung ( fig. 4a , black bar ) were determin in dilut sampl use elisa . each bar repres the arithmet mean titer of individu group \\u00b1 se . the statist signific of the differ between

alon ; \\n ag+pika , 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov plus 100 \\u00b5g of pika . this approach could help to elicit hiv immunogen specif iga and igg respons in vagin , fecal and saliva sampl [ 4 ] . a parenter administ viruslik particl even elicit 90 % to 100 % efficaci against infect and pre-invas diseas in previous uninfect individu [ 15 ] . \\n for determin correl between neutral activ and antibodi in serum and mucos secret , both igg and iga respons in serum and in mucos secret were test . in our studi , neutral activ was detect in lung sampl from three group of mice , in which onli specif igg but not iga could be detect ( fig. 2 - 4 ) . antibodi analysi also indic that it was specif igg but not specif iga respons at mucos site that was correl with neutral activ . it is veri possibl that mucos igg could also play an import role in contribut to the neutral activ at mucos site . it has been propos [ 41 ] , serum igg induc in parenter immun could find it way to the mucosa to exert protect effect . the relat high concentr of igg seen at particular mucos site may reflect a combin of constitut transcellular or paracellular transport from the system compart and specif transport mechan [ 41 ] . \\n therefor , detect of igg respons in mucos site is also use for evalu of mucos immun respons and relat neutral activ . \\n becaus sars-cov infect occur at mucos surfac , such as lung , digest surfac and even vagin surfac [ 20 , 21 , 26 , 38 , 40 ] , the induct of a neutral activ which could block virus attach and infect is more import in sars-cov prevent . our studi show that pika was effect at induc neutral activ at mucos site when co-administ by intraperiton and intranas immun ( fig. 2 ) . intranas immun appear less effect than intraperiton immun at elicit neutral activ , even when adjuv with pika . this may partial result from certain loss of vaccin antigen , dilut by mucos secret , captur by mucus gel , attack by proteas and nucleas , or exclus by epitheli cell when deliv through mucos rout [ 30 ] . \\n howev , it should be note that intranas immun could induc much higher specif iga respons than intraperiton immun . mani studi alreadi demonstr that mucos siga can inhibit viral infect via immun exclus , intracellular virus neutral , and transepitheli transport of immun complex [ 17 , 28 , 44 ] . even rotavirus vp6-specif iga monoclon antibodi that lack neutral activ can protect mice against infect by ] rotavirus via an intracellular neutral mechan [ 5 ] . sars-cov-specif siga may also provid a similar kind of protect against sars-cov invas at mucos site in the absenc of classic neutral activ . if this is true , the in vitro neutral activ may onli reflect partial correl with the protect effect of immun respons . \\n the adjuvant of pika may be most deriv from it main compon poly(i : c ) . howev , the adjuv mechan of poly(i : c ) is not clear understood yet although it is believ to be relat with to dsrna structur and tlr3 mediat immun respons . in-vivo , the presenc of viral dsrna can trigger cellular immun respons to viral infect through the activ of dsrna-depend enzym includ pkr , and the ifn-induc 2'-5'-adenyl synthase/rnas l system [ 12 , 16 ] . in addit , mammalian tlr3 's can recogn viral dsrna , lead to the activ of nf-\\u03bab and the product of type 1 interferon which can serv as a bridg between the innat and adapt immun system [ 1 ] . takeshi [ 11 ] . \\n for develop and applic of an adjuv for human use , the prioriti is it safeti . ct is the most potent known mucos adjuv , but it has advers side effect , such as nasal discharg in human . here we determin the mucos adjuvant of a new adjuv , pika , which is a deriv of poly(i : c ) . \\n poly(i : c ) itself is toxic to human and can be rapid hydrolyz despit it strong adjuvant [ 6 ] . pika is an improv adjuv which was formul as a [ 26 ] . all togeth , pika is well formul as a stabl and safe adjuv . \\n in summari , we have demonstr that both intraperiton and intranas administr of pika as an adjuv can signific rais the humor immun respons with neutral activ against sars-cov in serum and mucos site . therefor , pika is a good adjuv candid and can be also use as mucos vaccin .\",\n          \"abstract viral filtrat is a critic step in the purif of biolog and in the monitor of microbiolog water qualiti . viral filter are

ikner et al. 2012 ) . in addit , particul air filter are use in person respiratori protect equip ( i.e. , face mask and respir ) cohen and birkner 2012 ; rengasami et al. 2004 ) to ensur shortrang protect of wearer against airborn pathogens-which includ a number of virus ( tang et al. 2006 ) -and in air purifiers/clean to limit longrang aerosol transmiss of infect in healthcar set ( hyttinen et al. 2011 ; tang et al. 2006 ) . \\n cellulos membran microfilt have been use routin for age in laboratori to perform the socal '' steril filtrat '' ( cold steril ) , i.e. , the absolut remov of bacteria , yeast and mold but not virus ( walsh and denyer 2012 ) from heat-sensit liquid media . howev , mani virus filtrat devic current implement are made from cellulos and it deriv . some eighti year ago , gradocol , grade collodion ( cellulos nitrat ) membran filter ( elford 1931 ; bauer and hugh 1934 ) have been extens use in ultrafiltr to estim the size of sever medic import virus such as foot-and-mouth diseas ( galloway and elford 1931 ) , vaccinia ( elford and andrew 1932 ) , herp ( elford et al. 1933 ) , poliomyel ( elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza ( elford et al. 1936 ) ( see also ferri ( 1936 ) for an exhaust review ) . later on , commerci mix cellulos ester filter with veri low pore size , name vf ( virus fine ) , vm ( virus medium ) and vc ( virus coars ) grade filter produc by millipor ( billerica , ma , usa-a subsidiari of merck kgaa , darmstadt , germani ) , have also been appli to virus ultrafiltr for group by size assess ( hsiung 1965 ) . as part of a seri of paper survey the antivir applic of polysaccharide-bas materi , the present review focus on viral filtrat use cellulos filter media-most of which are commerci avail product that have been extens test over the past twenti year for the removal/concentration/purif of viral particl from liquid sampl , i.e. , biopharmaceut ( name blood product ) and environment ( raw or treat ) water sampl . the applic of cellulose-bas filter in individu respiratori protect devic protect the wearer against airborn viral pathogen is also detail . polysaccharide-bas chromatograph adsorb for viral clearanc or recovery/purif of virus or virus-lik particl will be present elsewher . \\n in the process of biolog product , virus remov from the product stream while provid maximum product recoveri is a critic task . it is more particular difficult to elimin small viral particl such as parvovirus , which may contamin blood product and mammalian cell cultur use in the product of recombin protein ( charcosset 2006 ) . viral filter develop to answer this challeng are typic membran ( screen ) filter ensur a size-bas reject of viral particl via a siev mechan . given the size of virus , rang rough from 20 ( parvovirida ) to 400 nm ( poxvirida ) ( segura et al. 2011 ) , viral filtrat stand between microfiltr and ultrafiltr among pressure-driven filtrat process ( fig. 2 ) , though it is frequent but incorrect ( van rei and zydney 2007 ) classifi as nanofiltr ( burnouf et al. 2005 ) . \\n 2.1 regener cellulos hollow fiber ( hf ) membran filter \\n common virus filtrat membran are made from poly(ethersulfon ) ( pes ) , poly(vinyliden fluorid ) ( pvdf ) , and regener cellulos ( burnouf and radosevich 2003 ; carter and lutz 2002 ; liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ) . among the latter , the commerci planova tm filter ( asahi kasei medic , tokyo , japan ) have been wide use to clear virus from biolog produc pharmaceut , in particular blood product . planova filter are compos of cuprammonium regener cellulos hf ( bemberg tm cupro fiber ) , prepar from cellulos cuprammonium spin solut via microphas separ under precis spin condit ( tsurumi et al. 1990b , c ) . the wall of each hf has a threedimension web structur of pore consist of larg , bulki void pore interconnect by fine capillari ( tsurumi et al. 1990a , b , c ) ( fig. 3 ) . dure filtrat , as the feed solut contain the product of interest is circul through the hf bore , virus accumul in the larg , bulki void pore of the fiber network while the product solut pass through the capillari pore . sinc the hf wall is sever ten of micromet thick ( fig. 4 ) , virus are captur gradual insid the porous structur that can be consid multi-lay ( 100 - 200 layer ) ( hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ) . henc , planova filter behav like '' membran depth filter '' ( walsh and denyer 2012 ) oper on the basi of size exclus . they offer a choic of 4 nomin mean pore size , name 15 nm ( 15n ) , 19 nm ( 20n ) , 35 nm ( 35n ) and 72 nm (75n)-the larg pore 75n model be essenti use as a prefilt to remov impur or aggreg prior to final virus filtration-and can be oper in normal ( dead-end/flow through ) or tangenti flow ( cross flow ) filtrat mode ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . planova filter have emerg to answer a publichealth problem of worldwid magnitud , i.e. , blood contamin by hiv ( hamamoto et al. 1989 ; manab et al. 1989 ) and hepat virus ( yuasa et al. 1991 ; sekiguchi et al. 1989 sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . tabl 1 give exampl of viral clearanc studi assess the capac of planova filter to remov virus from blood product . in these viral clearanc assay , product stream result from success , scaleddown purif step repres of the manufactur process of the product ( kundu and reindel 2007 ) , were artifici contamin ( '' spike '' ) with model virus of differ size ( tabl 2 ) ( at much higher concentr than what might be common found in the product intermedi ) befor be submit to filtrat . the virus remov effici of the filtrat step was express as lrv ( log reduct valu , i.e. , log ratio of the viral load in the spike product feed stream to that recov in the product filtrat ) , which impli that residu virus infect can never be reduc to zero but may be great reduc mathemat ( ich 1999 ) . minimum lrv valu were most frequent given . they were estim when no virus could be detect in filter sampl take into account the detect limit of the assay ( viral titer estim as 1 infecti unit per sampl volum ) . from the measur lrvs , the filtrat oper is usual classifi as effect ( lrv [ 4 ) , moder effect ( 1 \\\\ lrv \\\\ 4 ) or makino et al. ( 1994 ) rev environ sci biotechnol ( 2017 ) ineffect ( lrv \\\\ 1 ) ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . sinc filtrat complement other viral clearanc method in the downstream process of biotherapeut ( brorson 2007 ; klamroth et al. 2014 ; shukla et al. 2007 ) , sever studi quot in tabl 1 also report lrvs for common virus reduct step such as inactiv by pasteur ( gr\\u00f6ner 2014 ; gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2007 ) or solvent/deterg treatment ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 ) , and chromatograph captur ( gr\\u00f6ner 2014 ; gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ) . virus remov dure the plasma fraction process ( bryant and klein 2007 ) lead from the crude plasma pool to the product ( immunoglobulin here ) stream has also been quantifi ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 ) . overal virus reduct factor obtain by addit of success lrvs are given in these work , as illustr by tabl 3 . in the virus spike studi quot in tabl 1 , the actual viral filtrat step was preced by prefiltr to elimin viral and/or protein aggreg that might be present in the spike product solut . the presenc of aggreg virus may lead to overestim of size exclus effect while contribut with protein aggreg to the foul of viral filter , which reduc the membran hydraul permeabl and may affect virus retent ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . pre-filtr was perform on the spikevirus stock suspens ( caballero et al. 2014 ; gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; robert et al. 2010 ) on the product intermedi befor virus inocul ( gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ) , and/or on the virus furuya et al. ( 2006 ) and terpstra et al. ( 2006 ) cpv canin parvovirus b19 v gr\\u00f6ner ( and terpstra et al. ( 2006 terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spike materi ( chtourou et al. 2007 ; dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 terpstra et al. , 2007 . for pre-filtr of the virus prepar , micro filter with a pore size adapt to the spike virus size , i.e. , slight lower than the virus size , were use to remov cell aggreg but not singl viral particles-usu pore size rang between 0.1 and 0.45 lm . micro filter with 0.1 - 0.2 lm pore size ( koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2007 ; , but also 75n ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ) and 35n ( chtourou et al. 2007 ) . planova viral filter were use to pre-filtr the spike product solut . in the latter work , the associ in seri of 35n and 15n filter led to effici remov of small virus such as ppv ( chtourou et al. 2007 ) . this was not the case when 35n was use as the main viral filter after pre-filtr with 75n ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ) , which confirm previous date show that the 35 nm pore size was too larg to retain the smallest viral particl ( furuya et al. 2006 ; hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ) . both 20n ( caballero et al. 2014 ; furuya et al. 2006 ; gr\\u00f6ner 2014 ) and 15n ( caballero et al. 2014 ; robert et al. 2010 ; terpstra et al. 2007 ; planova filter and their combin ( gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012 ; koenderman et al. 2012 ) show effect virus remov over a wide rang of viral particl size ( tabl 1 ) . as a general rule , the remov effici of the filter increas with the ratio of pore size to virus size , as illustr by gr\\u00f6ner ( 2014 ) and terpstra et al. ( 2007 ) . this was also demonstr by robert et al. ( 2010 ) by filtrat poliovirus type 1 ( a picorvanirus ) through planova filter manufactur with differ pore size , rang between 15 ( lrv = 6.9 ) and 35 nm ( lrv = 0.2 ) . the two-filt combin were global more effici than singl filter at remov small virus from spike protein intermedi , though two 15n filter connect in parallel for tangenti filtrat ( koenderman et al. 2012 ) yield lrvs quit similar to those obtain use 15n alon ( terpstra et al. 2006 ) . care should be taken when compar vertic the data collect in tabl 1 , howev . in addit to the size of viral particl and filter pore , the result of such virus-spik studi are depend on a number of process paramet such as the filtrat oper condit ( filtrat mode , transmembran pressur , volum per filter area , tempera-tur \\u2026 ) , the characterist of the product feed stream ( ph , conduct , natur and concentr of the product \\u2026 ) , or els the puriti level and concentr of the virus spike . moreov , sever studi includ pre-filtr ( dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ) or viral inactiv ( koenderman et al. 2012 ; terpstra et al. 2006 ) in the calcul of lrvs . this variabl in test condit for filtration-bas virus remov make difficult ani comparison between lrvs collect from multipl sourc as in tabl 1 , even though some result ( caballero et al. 2014 ; hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ; robert et al. 2010 ) contradict it influenc on filtrat perform , underlin the robust of the filtrat process . also , some variat in virus remov capac may occur between commerci filter modul owe to their manufactur from differ batch of hf , as illustr by robert et al. ( 2010 ) for 15n filter . \\n like membran microfiltr , depth filtrat is wide use as a clarif step in biopharmaceut purif to ensur remov of cell debri , larg aggreg and contamin from the product stream prior to purif process such as column/membran chromatographi and viral filtration/inactiv step ( liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ; vicent et al. vicent et al. 2011a , b ) . commerci avail depth filter current employ in bioprocess are compos of cellulos fiber with a porous inorgan filter aid and a resin binder , general cation . for instanc , the zeta plus tm filter media ( 3 m purif inc.-form cuno , meriden , ct , usa ) is compos of a cellulos fiber depth matrix contain silica-bas filter-aid materi and posit charg by chemic bound of a cation charg modifi ( ostreich 1991 ) . \\n vari retent rate are avail ( 0.1 - 1.0 lm ) . the tripl layer a1hc filter media from emd millipor includ two depth filtrat layer ( cellulos ? diatomac earth ) of differ grade and a 0.1 lm-pore-s micropor membran pre-filt made of mix cellulos ester ( van rei and zydney 2007 ) . henc , these cellulos depth filter reli on both size exclus and electrostat adsorpt bind to effect separ ( liu et al. 2010 ) . in viral spike studi ( barnett et al. 2012 ; dichtelm\\u00fcl et al. 2012 ; zhou et al. 2008 ) , they were found to retain viral particl whose surfac is negat charg over a wide rang of ph as their isoelectr point ( pi ) rang most frequent between 3.5 and 7.0 , with a mean valu of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 ( michen and graul 2010 ) . \\n virus are recogn as a major caus of waterrel diseas ( bosch et al. 2008 ; fong and lipp 2005 ; gibson 2014 ; hamza et al. 2011 ) . enter virus , more particular , which are associ primarili with gastrointestin ill ( bosch et al. 2008 ; fong and lipp 2005 ; gibson 2014 ; hamza et al. 2011 ) , are impli in most waterborn viral outbreak ( gibson 2014 ; hamza et al. 2011 ) . all type of water , includ water use for drink ( surfac or ground suppli ) , recreat water ( fresh , marin , and swim pool ) , agricultur water for irrig ( river and groundwat ) and wast water ( sewag or industri effluent ) , have been shown to be potenti vehicl for virus transmiss ( bosch et al. 2008 ) . \\n contamin is most frequent of fecal origin ( bosch et al. 2008 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . although viral level may be high at the contamin sourc , e.g. , concentr rang between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particl per gram of fece are refer to in the literatur ( michen and graul 2010 ) , viral concentr as low as 1 - 10 viral particl per liter may be found in environment water ( julian and schwab 2012 ) . sinc enter virus display high infect ( fong and lipp 2005 ; julian and schwab 2012 ) , such titer may constitut a health risk and should be detect for reliabl surveil of viral pathogen in water . as a consequ , effici concentr method are need to captur virus in large-volum water sampl and releas the retain viral materi in concentr form . most common method are base on filtrat process ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; ikner et al. 2012 ) . in particular , virus adsorptionelut ( viradel ) filter method have been wide implement sinc the 1970s ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ) . briefli , in a viradel method , virus from aqueous sampl are revers adsorb to micropor filter and then elut from the filter in a small liquid volum ( apha , awwa and wef 1998 ) . adsorb filter carri electr charg and virus retent occur via electrostat interact rather than by size exclus . in other word , viradel filter act as depth filter rather than siev . contrari to viral filter that retain virus by a siev mechan to achiev complet viral clearanc , their pore size lie in the micropor rang , which allow the high flow filtrat necessari for virus captur in larg water sampl . posit or negat charg filter can be use in a viradel procedur , among which those made of cellulos materi have been domin over the last few decad . \\n sinc their pi is below the ph of natur water ( i.e. , around neutral ) ( \\n huang et al. ( 2000 ) tabl 5 continu filter type a water natur no. \\n [ 0 test earlier for concentr of virus in water sampl of differ origin ( tabl 4 ) . more recent studi made use of zeta plus tm 1 mds microfilt , howev ( tabl 5 ) . in these work , pure ( e.g. , distil ) , tap , environment or sewag water sampl were seed with vari enter virus that are common waterborn pathogen , i.e. , member of the famili picornavirida ( poliovirus , coxsakievirus , teschovirus ) , adenovirida ( adenovirus ) , calicivirida ( norovirus , calicivirus ) and reovirida ( rotavirus ) ( fong and lipp 2005 ) , or bacteriophag ( enterobacteria phage ) that are consid as altern indic of fecal contamin and as index organ for the presenc of enter virus in water ( goodridg and steiner 2012 ) . natur contamin water contain suffici level of indigen virus , more particular bacteriophag , were also use in addit to spike studi sensu stricto ( tabl 4 ) . follow sampl filtrat , viral particl adsorb to the filter were elut in concentr form use a varieti of elut solut , the most common eluent consist of a slight alkalin ( ph 9.0 - 9.5 ) protein solut ( i.e. , beef extract ) , frequent buffer with glycine-naoh or anoth amino acid solut ( sometim supplement with salt to aid disrupt of electrostat interact between virus and filter ( shield and farrah 1983 ) , a chaotrop agent ( e.g. , urea ) or a surfact ( e.g. , tween 80 ) to affect virus-filt hydrophob interact . elut virus were quantified-us plaqu titer assay , 50 % tissu cultur infecti dose ( tcid 50 ) , quantit realtim pcr ( qpcr ) and reverse-transcript pcr ( rt-qpcr ) ( hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recoveri effici of the filtrat step by compar to input titer . this effici depend on a number of process paramet includ the filter type and filtrat condit ( e.g. , filtrat rate and pressur ) , the elut buffer composit and elut condit , the natur , input titer and titrat method of the test virus-in addit to the water matrix characterist that may affect virus quantif and filter perform ( borchardt et al. 2013 ) . henc , tabl 4 and 5 display a wide rang of recoveri yield . in practic test aim at the detect of naturallyoccur virus in field , large-volum water sampl , the filtrat ( adsorption-elut ) step is usual a primari concentr step which is follow by a secondari one to reach the virus detect threshold , e.g. , organ floccul or peg precipit ( lewi and metcalf 1988 ) . the recoveri yield of such two-step concentr process was evalu in sever studi use seed or natur contamin water sampl ( tabl 4 , 5 ) . as a general rule , the viral loss due to secondari concentr was balanc by a huge increas in concentr factor allow virus detect in water concentr from large-volum sampl , as report by chang et al. ( 1981 ) and raphael et al. ( 1985 ) for indigen enterovirus in wastewat and rotavirus in sewage-pollut surfac water , respect . after determin the optim elut condit for 1 mds disk-adsorb norovirus follow filtrat of spike distil water sampl , lee et al. ( 2011 ) ( tabl 5 ) appli the optim procedur to the detect of norovirus in environment water . they combin adsorpt filtrat use 1 mds cartridg with organ floccul to enrich virus from largevolum surfac ( 200 l ) and ground ( 500 l ) water sampl . this integr two-step process led to high volum reduct factor , i.e. , 10,000 and 25,000 for surfac and ground water sampl , respect ( 200 - 5009 for filtrat , 509 for organ floccul ) , but it recoveri effici was not evalu by spike studi . in the same way , besid spike woo et al. ( 2012 ) . a ratio of the virus surviv factor in the treat filter to that in the untreat filter , where the virus surviv factor in a filter is the number of virus recov by elut from the filter divid by the number of virus remov by the filtrat process . b pf pp filter from commerci surgic mask ( dupont tm 01361n ) , ccf coars pore cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 54 , 22 lm pore size ) , fcf fine pore cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 50 , 2.7 lm pore size ) studi like those detail in tabl 5 , 1 mds filter cartridg have been wide appli to concentr enter virus in water sampl of differ origin ( tabl 6 ) , rang from large-volum sampl of weak contamin water intend for drink or drink water product ( borchardt et al. 2003 ( borchardt et al. , 2004 lee et al. 2014 ; sedmak et al. 2005 ; verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewat sampl with high viral content-to assess the virus remov effici of wastewat treatment plant ( kuo et al. 2010 ; simmon et al. 2011 ) . in these test of field water sampl for enter virus , 1 mds filtrat was main combin with second-stag concentr by organ floccul as detail by fout et al. ( 2001 ) in the usepa ( unit state environment protect agenc ) manual of method for virolog . the elut of filter-adsorb viral particl was most perform with an alkalin beef extract solut supplement or not with glycin ( buffer eb3 and eb1 in tabl 5 ) . the work by verheyen et al. ( 2009 ) is an except to these common procedur . to concentr virus in small-volum sampl from drink water sourc , these author use two filter cartridg in seri with no addit concentr step and an alkalin powder milk solut as elut buffer . they found that 20 % ( 3/15 ) and 13 % ( 32/247 ) of surfac and ground ( well ) water sourc , respect , were contamin with adenovirus , with veri few sampl posit to rotavirus ( 0/15 surfac water sampl , 6/247 well water sourc ) . despit the differ in virus concentr method , these result compar with those obtain by xagoraraki et al. ( 2007 ) and cheong et al. ( 2009 ) for adenovirus detect in surfac ( 14/58 sampl , 24 % ) and ground water ( 4/29 sampl , 14 % ) , respect . they also agre with data report by borchardt et al. ( 2003 ) and cheong et al. ( 2009 ) show the low contamin level of ground water by rotavirus . it is worth note here , howev , that the number of posit sampl report in these viral analys of water ( and the other quot in tabl 6 ) is depend on the sensit of the detect techniqu use to assess the presenc of virus , i.e. , nucleic acid-bas amplif method such as convent pcr , reverse-transcript pcr ( rt-pcr ) , nest pcr , real-tim pcr/rt-pcr or integr cell cultur pcr ( icc/pcr ) to determin virus infect ( fong and lipp 2005 ; hamza et al. 2011 , mattison and bidawid 2009 ; watzing et al. 2006 ) with differ detect threshold . \\n it emerg from this glanc at literatur that cellulose-bas electroposit filter are still common use for viral monitor of water . these filter are expens , howev , and face competit with cheaper product , in particular nanoalumina fiber filter and glass wool filter ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . the former , nanoceram tm filter manufactur by argonid corpor ( sanford , fla. , usa ) , are compos of nanos ( 2 nm diamet ) , alumina-bas { main boehmit , c-alo(oh ) } fibrill dispers in a microglass fiber matrix , result in an electroposit filter media with 2 - 3 lm averag pore size kaledin 2005 , 2006 ) . the latter consist of commerci sodocalc glass wool coat with miner oil ( type bourr 725 qn/tech loos wool , isov saint-gobain , courbevoi , franc ) , hand pack into column or filter holder in the laboratori ( vilagin\\u00e8 et al. 1993 ) . these glass wool filter harbor electroposit site while present hydrophob surfac characterist . effici enrich of ( seed or/ and ) indigen virus from various water sampl use nanoceram ( gibbon et al. 2010 ; ikner et al. 2011 ; pang et al. 2012 ) , and glass wool ( debooser et al. 2011 ; lambertini et al. 2008 ; wyn-jon et al. 2011 ) filter has been report in recent year ( see also cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . compar with 1 mds filter ( tabl 5 ) , nanoceram filter show similar , slight lower ( mcminn 2013 ) or higher ( karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentr effici . \\n commerci avail under differ pore size ( 0.025 - 8.0 lm ) , mix cellulos ester membran filter are negat charg over a wide rang of ph valu , their overal negat charg increas with ph ( kessick and wagner 1978 ) . micropor filter in the 0.1 - 0.45 lm pore size rang have been use for age in laboratori and industri for size-bas filtrat of bacteri particl and cell debri ( surfac filter ) . these and larger pore size filter have been shown to retain enterovirus , howev , despit the much smaller size of viral particl compar to the nomin mean diamet of filter pore ( cliver 1968 ) . the presenc of salt enhanc virus adsorpt to cellulos ester membran , this effect increas with the cation valenc ( i.e. , al 3 ? [ mg 2 ? [ na ? ) ( walli et al. 1972 ) . acidif of the viral suspens also improv virus adsorpt effici , even in the absenc of exogen ad salt ( sobsey et al. 1973 ) . these earli result were later confirm by lukasik et al. ( 2000 ) , who investig the influenc of mono- , di- , and trival salt ( nacl , mgcl 2 , and alcl 3 ) on the adsorpt of poliovirus and enterobacteria phage to the mf-millipor tm membran filter type ha ( 0.45 lm pore size ) and the electroposit 3 m tm zeta plus tm 1 mds microfilt at neutral or acid ph. at ph 7 , salt promot virus adsorpt to ha filter while affect adsorpt to 1 mds filter . at ph 3.5 , more than 95 % of the virus test adsorb to ha filter with or without salt ad to the viral suspension-th salt interf again with viral adsorpt to 1mds filter . furthermor , the addit of urea or tween 80 to the salt solut affect virus adsorpt to both filter at ph 3.5 and ha filter at ph 7 . in agreement with previous studi by the same group ( haramoto et al. 2004 ( haramoto et al. , 2005 lukasik et al. ( 2000 ) explain these result by the antichaotrop effect of salt that increas hydrophob interact between filter and virus and was impair by the chaotrop agent or the deterg . at neutral ph , charg screeen by salt addit reduc electrostat attract and repuls forc between virus and 1 mds or ha filter , respect . cation-medi cross-complex between negat group on virus and filter surfac ( kessick and wagner 1978 ) and , more particular , strengthen hydrophob virusfilt interact contribut to improv the adsorpt effici of ha filter . at acid ph , virus display a posit surfac charg and their electrostat interact with ha filter switch from repuls to attractive-and invers for electroposit 1 mds filter . the presenc of salt probabl affect these interact but was balanc by the promot effect of salt on hydrophob interact . \\n henc , most test report so far for virus concentr from water sampl use cellulos ester filter ( essenti ha filter ) have been perform after addit of multival cation ( main mg 2 ? ) to the water sampl with or without ph adjust to an acid level . accord to katayama et al. ( 2002 ) , the virus-load filter were rins with an acid solut to elimin remain cation befor elut with naoh or other alkalin buffer . haramoto et al. ( 2004 haramoto et al. ( , 2005 haramoto et al. ( , 2007a propos a variat in the method that consist in pre-condit the filter with al 3 ? ion . aluminum chlorid was pass through the filter , make an electroposit ion coat , which avoid cation addit to the water sampl . the recoveri effici of both protocol has been evalu by seed water sampl with enter virus and bacteriophag and quantifi elut virus ( tabl 7 ) . similar to spike studi ( tabl 4 , 5 ) and viral analys of field water sampl ( tabl 6 ) with electroposit filter , the ha-bas filtration/elut process was frequent associ with a secondari concentr step to increas virus concentr factor . here , centrifug ultrafiltr ( cu ) use commerci millipor ( centriprep \\u00f2 , centricon \\u00f2 or amicon \\u00f2 ) concentr was the elect concentr method . these cu unit contain a low adsorpt regener cellulos membran ( ultracel \\u00f2 ) whose nomin molecular-weight cutoff rang between 3 and 100 kda-a mwco valu of 50 kda be most frequent select for secondari concentr of elut virus . they are routin use in laboratori to purifi and concentr biomacromolecul such as peptid , protein , and nucleic acid from small-volum biolog sampl ( e.g. , 2 - 15 ml for the centriprep filter unit ) . test or not for virus recoveri by spike experi , the combin concentr procedur have been extend to the detect of enter virus in field water sampl includ tap ( haramoto et al. 2004 ) , sea ( katayama et al. 2002 ) , river ( surfac ) ( fong et al. 2010 ; hamza et al. 2009 ; haramoto et al. 2005 ) and wast ( fong et al. 2010 ; katayama et al. 2008 ) water ( tabl 8) . sampl with differ volum were collect accord to the water sourc , i.e. , sampl volum increas as the expect contamin level decreas . for instanc , katayama et al. ( 2002 ) appli ha filtrat , follow by acid rins of the filter , viral elut with naoh and secondari concentr of the eluat by cu , to concentr natur occur virus ( norovirus , enterovirus and hav-hepat a virus ) in seawat sampl . base on the volum reduct factor ( 2-l sample/2 ml final concentr , i.e. , 1000 ) and the recoveri yield of the two-step process ( tabl 7 ) , a virus concentr factor of 670 was reach . onli hav virus was not detect in ani sampl test . later on , katayama et al. ( 2008 ) follow the same protocol to concentr enter virus in the raw influent of a wastewat treatment plant . sampl of 100-ml volum were collect and submit to the two-step concentr process , yield a volum reduct factor of c. 140 . the four test kind of enter virus were detect in all 72 wastewat sampl but one lack norovirus gi ( nov gi ) . use peg precipit as the secondari concentr step , hamza et al. ( 2009 ) test river water sampl for contamin by enter virus and bacteriophag . a volum reduct factor of 5000 ( 10-l sample/2 ml final concentr ) and virus concentr factor rang between 1000 ( norovirus ) and 5000 ( adenovirus ) ( see tabl 7 for recoveri yield ) were obtain . all 41 analyz sampl were found posit for enter virus . human adenovirus and norovirus were detect in 97.5 and 32 % of the sampl , respect . haramoto et al. ( 2004 ) illustr the abil of al 3 ? -coat filter to concentr virus from large-volum freshwat sampl without salt addit by detect norovirus in tap water from tokyo univers . tap water sampl ( 303-l averag volum ) underw two success filtration/elut step use 293-mm and 47-mm diamet ha filter prior to concentr by cu ( final volum : 0.9 ml ) , which ensur a volum reduct factor higher than 300,000 . howev , the virus recoveri effici of the 3-step concentr process was not evalu . ten of the 98 test sampl were found posit for norovirus . these result compar to those report by lee et al. ( 2011 ) ( tabl 5 ) use 1 mds cartridg with organ floccul to enrich norovirus from larg surfac and ground water sampl . \\n despit these promis data , the two viradel method base on electroneg filter ( i.e. , addit of mgcl 2 to water sampl or filter coat with al 3 ? ion befor filtrat ) have been essenti implement for viral analysi of water contain high amount of indigen virus , requir limit sampl volum ( tabl 8 ) -electroposit filter cartridg be more adapt to virus concentr from larg volum of weak contamin water ( tabl 6 ) . besid the above-ment work by haramoto et al. ( 2004 ) , onli two studi among those detail in tabl 8 describ virus detect in environment water sampl with low viral content , name drink water sourc after chlorin or without treatment ( rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwat from artesian well ( chironna et al. 2012 ) . both studi use small-volum sampl and cu as secondari concentr step , yield a modest volum reduct factor of 1000 . veri few from 202 artesian well water sampl were found posit to the test enter virus : none for hav and enterovirus , 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus ( chironna et al. 2012 ) . a larg proport ( 50 % ) of sampl from drinkingwat suppli was posit to adenovirus , howev ( rigotto et al. 2010 ) . these data are compat with viral analys of groundwat and water intend for drink perform use 1 mds filtrat as the first virus concentr step ( tabl 6 ) . it should be note , howev , that the same remark appli to data collect in tabl 8 as to those in tabl 6 concern the number of virus-posit sampl , i.e. , their depend on the virus detect method . this can be illustr by the two follow exampl . use icc-pcr ( measur infecti virus ) , katayama et al. ( 2002 ) detect enterovirus in 4 of 6 seawat sampl from bath beach , but no sampl was found posit by direct rt-pcr . de paula et al. ( 2007 ) found 48/52 river water sampl posit for hav by quantit real-tim rt-pcr , but onli 12/52 by nest rt-pcr . \\n as attest by the larg bodi of literatur data quot abov , virus adsorption-elut method use electroposit or electroneg filter are routin appli to the primari concentr of waterborn virus , each type of filter possess it own advantag and drawback . ultrafiltr is consid anoth filtration-bas option to concentr virus from water sampl ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; ikner et al. 2012 ) . it has been indic earlier that cu with microconcentr base on cellulos ultrafiltr disc is common use as a secondari concentr step follow the viradel process . hollow fiber ultrafiltr ( hfuf ) , howev , is consid a potenti techniqu for primari concentr of virus from large-volum water sampl , yield better virus recoveri than the viradel method perform with either electroposit or electroneg filter ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ) . commerci hfuf devic oper in cross-flow mode have been appli to the simultan concentr of biolog particl , includ virus , spike in tap ( polaczyk et al. 2008 ) or reclaim ( liu et al. 2012 ) water sampl , to virus recoveri from seed tap ( rhode et al. 2011 ) and estuarin ( hernandez-morga et al. 2009 ) water sampl , and also , more rare , to virus recoveri from field water sampl ( grassi et al. 2010 ; hernandez-morga et al. 2009 ) . most of these devic are dialyz that contain synthet hf made from polysulfon . follow the earli work by belfort et al. ( 1976 ) show that polysulfon hf membran were superior to cellulos acet one for virus concentr , virus concentr experi use hfuf dialyz equip with hf manufactur from cellulos are scarc . an exampl is given by liu et al. ( 2012 ) . they show that the exeltra plus 210 cellulos triacet hf dialyz ( baxter healthcar corp. , deerfield , il , usa ) and the optiflux \\u00f2 f200nr polysulfon dialyz ( fresenius medic care , walthamm , ma , usa ) provid similar recoveri effici for ms2 and ux174 bacteriophag , escherichia coli , clostridium perfringen spore , and cryptosporidium parvum oocyst from spike 10-l and 100-l sampl of reclaim water . \\n an array of viral infect can be transmit by the airborn rout , in particular via aerosol ( droplet nuclei ) tang et al. 2006 ; tellier 2006 ; verreault et al. 2008 ) . even though virus inactiv rate in the atmospher are general higher than those of bacteri and fungal contamin , virus-contain aerosol can spread worldwid ( despr\\u00e9 et al. 2012 ) . the threat of viral outbreak and pandem such as those caus by sar coronavirus ( yu et al. 2004 ) and high pathogen strain of influenza a virus ( tellier 2006 ) , alli with the fear of bioterror use virus ( e.g. , smallpox and hemorrhag fever virus ) ( barra and greub 2014 ) as biolog weapon , has encourag the search for effici protect equip against aerosol virus-contain particl . \\n individu respiratori protect devic consist in respir , i.e. , air-filt face mask design to protect the wearer against inhal of a hazard atmospher ( here airborn infecti aerosols)-oppos to surgic mask design to protect the environ from contamin generat by the wearer 's exhal breath ( i.e. , prevent of surgic infect ) . current , most '' filter facepiec '' ( ffp ) respir have a multilay composit structur with a central filter layer display electret properti ( gralton and mclaw 2010 ) . these electret filter ( thakur et al. 2013 ) are produc by impart an electrostat charg to a nonwoven fibrous mat compos of synthet polym fiber such as poly(propylen ) ( pp ) ( main ) , poly(butylen terephthal ) , poly(tetrafluoroethylen ) and poly(carbon ) fiber . electrostat charg of the filter media is common obtain by corona discharg , triboelectrif and electrostat spin ( tsai et al. 2002 ) . electret filter collect particl through the combin action of mechan and electrostat forc ( podg\\u00f3rski 2010 ; wang 2001 ( cen 2000 ) should retain respect at least 95 and 94 % of influent particl ( nacl particl are use as nonbiolog surrog particl ) ( rengasami et al. 2009 ) . first worn by surgic team a hundr year ago to prevent bacteri contamin of patient 's open wound , earli surgic mask were construct from layer of cellulos materi , more particular cotton cellulos ( gauz ) ( haller and colwel 1918 ) and deriv ( arnold 1938 ) ( see also belkin 1997 ) . much more recent , face mask made from cotton fabric have been test as altern respiratori protect equip against pandem outbreak such as influenza ( dato et al. 2006 ; davi et al. 2013 ; rengasami et al. 2010 ) . like respir , current commerci avail surgic face mask includ sever layer of non-woven fabric with , frequent , a cellulos inner layer in contact with the wearer 's face to improv wearer 's comfort . howev , the filter layer , usual made of meltblown fiber ( ghosh 2014 ) , is devoid of electret properti . sinc particul filtrat is onli mechan , i.e. , less effici than that of respir , most surgic mask are not certifi for use as respiratori protect devic , standard test to evalu their filtrat efficaci be less stringent ( oberg and brosseau 2008 ) . \\n while a number of studi have confirm that surgic mask logic offer lower protect than respir against aerosol particl , the effect of both type of face mask at prevent viral respiratori infect , in particular influenza , is still a matter of controversi ( bin-reza et al. 2012 ; cowl et al. 2010 ; gralton and mclaw 2010 ) . the improp facial fit of respir coia et al. 2013 ; weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protect effici against infecti aerosol . it allow particul flow outsid the filtrat area of the mask , result in face-s leak , i.e. , the leakag of infecti particl around the edg of the mask ( grinshpun et al. 2009 ; lei et al. 2013 ) . mask seal leakag can be minim by appli exist guidelin for correct don and fit check of respir . moreov , human face and head form model have been propos as a tool for design respir with improv protect effici , simul interact between face and facemask and describ their fit ( golshahi et al. 2013 ; lei et al. 2012 ) . the accumul of viral particl at the surfac and within the filtrat media of respir , where they can remain viabl and infecti for extend period of time ( coulliett et al. 2013 ; sakaguchi et al. 2010 ) , is anoth signific problem with which respir wearer are confront in the prevent of viral transmiss and spread . incorrect mask handl by the wearer may lead to accident self-inocul , cross-contamin affect both other healthcar worker and patient , and contamin of fomit ( casanova et al. 2008 ) . furthermor , the risk of virus reaerosol from respir dure extend use , if limit , can not be rule out ( fisher et al. 2012 ) . recommend for respir dof do exist but have proven insuffici to prevent virus transfer from respir to healthcar employe ' hand and cloth ( casanova et al. 2008 ) . ad antivir properti to the filtrat process may contribut to limit the risk of viral transmiss by improp handl of use respir . a number of virucid facemask have been develop and patent over the past 15 year ( tiliket et al. 2011 ) , some of which are commerci avail . in the spectrashield tm plus respir mask design by nexera medic inc. ( fort lauderdal , fla. ) ( haa 2008 ) , for instanc , two layer of filter media are sandwich between ( inner and outer ) antimicrobi layer where a silver-copp zeolit ( carrier ) antimicrobi agent ( agion \\u00f2 antimicrobi , sciessent llc , wakefield , mass. ) is embed around the core of synthet fiber ( fosshield \\u00f2 , foss manufactur , hampton , nh ) . the biofriend tm biomask tm ffp respir , manufactur by fillig ltd. ( hong kong ) and distribut by medlin industri , inc. ( mundelein , ill. ) , is anoth four-lay devic in which the melt-blown pp filtrat layer is insert between an inner layer of spunbond pp and two antivir layer , name a cellulose/polyest layer contain copper and zinc ion and an outer layer of spunbond pp treat with a low ph ( citric acidacidifi ) hydrophil plastic coat ( davison 2012 ; stewart et al. 2014 ) . the outer layer absorb infecti aerosol droplet and virus are denatur by exposur to citric acid . in the second layer , inactiv of virus with damag structur is complet by the virucid effect of dival metal cation . contribut to the overal antivir effici of the structur , the cellulos compon of this layer is a sulphat or sulfon rayon fabric ( stewart et al. 2012 ( stewart et al. , 2014 to which a varieti of viral human pathogen bind via the cation site of viral envelopes/capsid . \\n besid the commerci biomask tm respir , various composit structur design for filtrationinactiv of airborn microbi contamin , where cellulos materi play an activ antimicrobi role , have been patent in recent year bernard 2006 ; nakamura and nakamura 2011 ; tsutsumi 2009 ; zhang et al. 2012 ; zhong 2011 ) . sever of them are base on bacteri cellulos layers/co provid with an antimicrobi compon , i.e. , silver ( zhong 2011 ) or zeolite-support silver ( nakamura and nakamura 2011 ) nanoparticl , and chitosan ( zhang et al. 2012 ) . the respiratori protect mask describ by zhong ( 2011 ) compris a three-lay bacteri cellulos membran whose middl layer contain silver nanoparticl . the antimicrobi facemask invent by nakamura and nakamura ( 2011 ) includ two base cloth element both of which are made of a woven textil ( gauz ) , a nonwoven cellulos fabric ( e.g. , rayon ) , or a porous sheet ( e.g. , a 0.3 - 0.5 mm slice sheet of urethan spong ) . the first base cloth is fill with bacteri cellulos nanofib that retain silver zeolit and a humect ( e.g. , trehalos or 1,3-butylen glycol ) in their network structur . addit antimicrobi properti are provid to the mask by impregn the second base cloth with a carboxyl acid ( e.g. , citric acid ) . zhang et al. ( 2012 ) also use bacteri cellulos in a composit antimicrobi materi suitabl for respiratori protect mask . a nonwoven polym fabric rev environ sci biotechnol ( 2017 ) 16:455 - 489 479 was coat with a film of bacteri cellulos mix with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improv the film-form properti , mechan strength and air permeabl of the coating-and chitosan , a non-sulf polysaccharid produc commerci by deacetyl of chitin that display strong antibacteri potenc ( kong et al. 2010 ; rabea et al. 2003 ) and , to a lesser extent , antivir activ ( rabea et al. 2003 ; wang et al. 2012 ) . \\n in the antimicrobi air filtrat devic propos by bernard ( 2006 ) , cellulos derivatives-mor particular , cellulos acet phthalat ( cap ) , a common pharmaceut excipi for enter coat of tablet and capsul with antivir activ ( pirron et al. 2011 ) -were use as '' biocid prophylact compound '' to provid the classic filter media ( e.g. , a nonwoven pp web , electrostat charg or not ) with antimicrobi properti . cellulos deriv could be incorpor as fiber or particl ( micron fiber ) into the air filtrat devic either in a separ layer posit befor or after the filter media , or deposit onto the outer surfac of the filter media relat to the air flow direct . to illustr this invent , handsheet prepar from cap fiber intermix or not with cap particl were success test for virucid efficaci by exposur to an aerosol challeng of enterobacteria phage \\u00f8x174 . \\n by exploit the antimicrobi properti of dialdehyd polysaccharid such as starch and cellulos dialdehyd , baney et al. ( 2012 ) propos a new method for produc low-cost virucid filter suitabl for respiratori protect mask . the treatment of a standard cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 50 filter paper ) with sodium period improv it antivir potenc due to oxid of some cellulos to dialdehyd cellulos insid the filter . challeng with aerosol of ms2 enterobacteria phage at high relat humid ( 90 % at 23 \\u00b0 c ) , the treat filter show higher filtrat effici than a control , untreat one , i.e. , better remov of viabl viral particl ( plaqu form unit ) join to a lower resist to air flow ( pressur drop)-du to increas pore size distribut ( woo et al. 2011 ) . higher inactiv of ms2 virus by the treat filter was also highlight , confirm an improv of it disinfect capabl ( woo et al. 2011 ) . howev , the filtrat and inactiv of airborn virus were less effect at lower moistur content of the filter , i.e. , at air humid level common encount in hospit set , in particular oper room ( balara et al. 2007 ) . furthermor , the inhal resist of the treat filter remain too high for applic to respiratori protect mask . the same pros and con appli to cellulos paper filter treat by immers into aqueous suspens of dialdehyd starch ( das ) ( woo et al. 2012 ) . while this treatment did not affect the remov effici of viabl ms2 virus from aerosol at high relat humid , virus surviv on the treat filter was reduc ( fig. 5 ) and the pressur drop decreas as das concentr increas . the drop in air flow resist remain insuffici for practic applic to respir . das treatment of a pp filter from a commerci ffp mask did not modifi the filtrat paramet ( virus remov effici and pressur drop ) of the filter but signific improv it biocid efficaci ( fig. 5 ) -an open of this treatment toward the develop of virucid facemask . anoth exampl of cellulos filter materi treat with cellulos deriv to yield antivir properti is given by tsurumi ( tsutsumi 2009 ) . this inventor devis a low-cost virucid mask filter made of a standard cellulos nonwoven fabric impregn with water extract of sulfon or amin styrenegraft cellulos . to reinforc the water retent properti of the filter media , a superabsorb resin such as poly(acryl acid ) was ad to the graft cellulos extract befor impregn of the fabric or incorpor into a separ layer cover the impregn fabric . low ( hydrogen ion from sulfon acid group ) or high ( hydroxyl ion generat by amin group ) ph condit insid the hydrat materi were claim to make it virucid against influenza a virus and calicivirus . the patent give no illustr of such antivir properti , howev . \\n studi publish by tiliket et al. ( 2011 ) and catel-ferreira et al. ( 2015 ) present anoth type of cellulosebas materi for airborn virus filtrat in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulos materi , i.e. , commerci kimwip \\u00f2 ( kw ) wipe ( kimberly-clark worldwid , inc. , dalla , tex . ) , was chemic modifi by coat with a synthet polym , i.e. , poly(ethylenimin ) ( pei ) ( tiliket et al. 2011 ) or graft of an antivir agent , i.e. , catechin ( catel-ferreira et al. 2015 ) . the filtrat effici of the modifi filter media was first test on aerosol t4d virus ( enterobacteria phage t4 , doermann 's strain t4d ) . then the treat filter was insert insid a commerci medic mask in place of it cellulos layer ( kolmi m24001 mask , kolmi-hopen , saint-barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'anjou , franc ) , and the reconstruct mask was challeng with td4 aerosol to evalu it virus remov effici . both treatment signific improv the virus captur factor ( ratio of upstream to downstream pfu content ) of kw cellulos wipe and of reconstruct commerci mask compar to origin mask and to mask reconstruct with untreat wipe . in these studi , the breathabl of reconstruct mask was not quantifi , nor was the virus surviv on the modifi filter media . howev , addit filtrat experi use aerosol of influenza a virus ( low pathogen h5n2 strain ) show that challeng viral particl accumul in pei function kw layer with no loss in number and infect ( tiliket et al. 2011 ) . thus these modifi mask show no virucid effect , the peimodifi layer behav like an electret media owe to the polycation charact of pei . on the other hand , sinc catechin and catechin-graft wipe show antivir activ against t4d virus in liquid media ( catel-ferreira et al. 2015 ) , it may be assum that part of virus accumul in excess in the treat wipe were inactiv by the polyphenol agent , i.e. , the reconstruct mask were actual virucid . \\n despit these few exampl , the use of cellulos media in filtrat devic aim at the captur of airborn viral particl remain now veri limit compar to filtrat of virus-contamin liquid sampl . while patent , sever cellulose-bas , virucid filter media design for insert in air filter face mask have not been commerci develop yet . \\n besid the wear of person respiratori protect equip , anoth aspect of the fight against airborn infect lie in the decontamin of indoor air in healthcar facil , and , more general , of air process through heat , ventil and air condit ( hvac ) system in the built environ . high effici particul air ( hepa ) filter are the primari technolog use for particul remov in these collect protect devices- with uv irradi , ozon or air ionize to yield indoor air decontamin ( bolashikov and melikov 2009 ; jacob et al. 2013 ) -and may be complement with a photytocatalyst such as tio 2 to improv the inactiv of accumul microorgan pigeot-remi et al. 2014 ) . sinc hepa filter are essenti made of glass fiber , they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retent properti will not be detail further . \\n most frequent associ with other virus reduct ( virus clearanc of biopharmaceut ) or concentr ( viral analysi of water ) step , size-exclus and/ or adsorpt ( charg mediat ) filtrat is an essenti tool to fight against viral contamin in aqueous media . owe to inher properti of cellulos , includ mechan strength and hydrophil ( that oppos protein adsorpt and biofoul ) , alli with widespread avail and biocompat , cellulose-bas materi are still wide present in viral filter . develop commerci over the past thirti year , sever cellulos filter media have been and continu to be use for both routin analys in laboratori and academ research studi aim at improv the filtrat perform , generat a wealth of data quantifi the effici of virus remov or recovery/concentr from biolog or water sampl , respect . \\n as concern biopharmaceut compound , these data aris from valid studi of the filtrat step perform by spike intermedi biolog solut ( most blood protein ) from multistag purif process with known titer of viral particl . regener cellulos hf planova filter n15-n35 , oper in the dead-end mode as a singl filter or two unit in seri , were shown to provid lrv valu rang between 4 and 7 , on the averag . increas test sinc their launch in 1989 , these cellulos filter compet with filter media made of synthet polym such as pvdf ( e.g. , viresolv \\u00f2 nfp-normal flow parvovirus-from emd millipor ;

METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.\",\n          \"250 words VIRAL ETIOLOGY AND OUTCOME OF SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS AMONG CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO THE PICU ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the viral etiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their clinical significance and prognosis among critically ill children.\\nPatients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded.\\nMain variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded.\\nResults: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV.

Summary This study applied molecular-based method to investigate the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in 59 commercial pig farms in South Korea. The results of RT-PCR screening on a relatively large collection of faeces samples (n = 681) from January 2013 to March 2015 did not reveal the presence of PDCoV until the end of 2014. However, on March 2015, PDCoV-positive samples (SL2, SL5) were detected from SL swine farm in Gyeongbuk province. The phylogenetic trees based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related to the US PDCoV strains rather than those in China. Thought Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) grouped within US PDCoV cluster, the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes suggested that they are different.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 Background On December 31 st , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] .\\nOver the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3] . In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum readiness level [4] . As of April 24, France is the 6 th most severely affected country in the world (in terms of absolute numbers), with approximately 120,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5] . With about 6,000 deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].\\nThe first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 th [7] : in a series of 18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7] [8] [9] [10] .\\nCancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of severe outcome [8, 10] . These retrospective reports, of limited size and restricted to patients hospitalized in Chinese hospitals, may not be fully transposable to Western healthcare systems, as suggested by a preliminary report on New Yorkers admitted to ICU [11] .\\nOur study reports the COVID-19 features and outcomes experienced by inpatients and outpatients actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH) in the Paris area, France.\\nAll rights reserved.

Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19\\nwere hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external intensive care units.\\nSurgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (\\\"plan blanc\\\") required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by learned societies [12] , included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.\\nMedical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national guidelines for breast cancer patients [12] : ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to 75 mg/m 2 . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and everolimus. Initiation of a new line of therapy with alpelisib was discouraged, but ongoing treatment was All rights reserved.

Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were systematically reduced by one half and were discontinued whenever possible.\\nRadiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was hypofractionated whenever possible [12, 13] Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the French society of palliative care [14] .\\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms, but subsequently became available to all cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the viral RdRp gene. All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [16, 17] , the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, focal consolidation and linear consolidation. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans. Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [19]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (0: no involvement; 1: \\u226410% of lung volumes; 2: 11-25%; 3: \\u226526% involvement).

Starting from March 13th, 2020, all proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered, as the registry also allowed for clinical follow-up phone calls scheduled at days 8, 14 and 28. More frequent and/or longer follow-up was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also registered and prospectively followed. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 th , 2020. This report was written according to the STROBE checklist.\\nThree populations were considered: patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR (positive RNA test); patients who had a positive RNA test or for whom RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but suggestive radiologic findings (COVID-19 patients); patients with symptoms only. Main outcome of patients were defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor analysis was performed. As a sensitivity analysis, prognostic factor analysis of death only was performed. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.\\nFrom March 13 th , 2020 to April 25 th , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in Figure 1A . RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41 patients) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings (N=18 patients).

Figure 1B .\\nBreast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1 . Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients (17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension (36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).\\nAbout two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing anti-cancer treatments were representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).\\nClinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 2 . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the 59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm 3 ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. The most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities, observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. Figure 2 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease: no significant association was observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19 lung disease.\\nAll patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home.

The flow of COVID-19 patients during the the course disease is shown in Figure 3 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24 th , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nNoteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).\\nFurther details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Supplementary Table 1 .\\nAn exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19 population showed that only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). They remained as prognostic factors in the RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast cancer patients.\\nWhile 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [20]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients, as a whole, are not at high risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This apparent low incidence could possibly be attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been All rights reserved.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.\\nIn terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the subgroup with positive RNA tests. As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.\\nWhile lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus of attention to define patients at high risk.

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.\\nMucosal immunity plays an important role in prevention of invasion by pathogens, which could be induced via systemic or mucosal immunization.\\nHowever, both immunization protocols require an effective adjuvant to produce better immune responses.\\nMucosally delivered antigen in the absence of an adjuvant usually induces either a low or undetectable antigen-specific immune response or results in immune tolerance [7, 43] . At present, a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States or elsewhere. Examples include oral vaccines, which mostly comprise live attenuated antigens, against Poliovirus [29] , V. cholerae, Salmonella typhi [22] , and Rotavirus [14] , and a nasal vaccine against influenza virus [3] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective mucosal adjuvant is a high priority in the development of efficient mucosal vaccine.\\nA synthetic dsRNA, termed Poly(I:C), has been found be able to boost immune responses since the 1960s [10, 45] . Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).\\nPIKA is a particular derivative of Poly (I:C) comprising kanamycin and calcium chloride [25] specific IgG and IFN-\\u03b3 responses in mice [33] . Most recent studies also showed that PIKA can provide broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses and coadministration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic H5N1 subunit vaccine can lead to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvements of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice [18, 19] .\\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of this \\nProduct [24] was inactivated with formaldehyde. PIKA is an improved adjuvant formulation comprising a derivative of Poly(I:C), kanamycin and calcium chloride [23, 33] , which was manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices by NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore.\\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Hubei CDC and maintained in SPF environment throughout the experiment. The mice were immunized through either an intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV or 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV plus the indicated dose of PIKA. Mice immunized with PBS served as a negative control. The protocol for intranasal immunization required the mice to be anesthetized slightly with sodium pentobarbital and held inverted with nose up until droplets of vaccine that were applied to both external nares were completely inhaled [13] . All intranasally immunizing reagents were suspended with PBS. Individual mice received 10 \\u00b5L of inoculants for five times with a 30 min resting interval between inoculations (total volume, 50 \\u00b5L). For intraperitoneal immunization, vaccine compositions were adjusted with PBS to a consistent 200 \\u00b5L dose. Each mouse received three immunizations with a 2-week interval between each immunization.\\nAll samples were collected two weeks after the final immunization as previously described [9] . Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital plexus puncture. Saliva was obtained after intraperitoneal injection with 20\\u00b5g of carbamylcholine chloride. The vaginal tract of individual mice was washed with 30\\u00b5L PBS for three times, with a total volume of 90\\u00b5L. After removing feces, small intestine tissues were weighed, cut into small pieces, mixed with PBS (100 mg of small intestine in 200\\u00b5L of PBS), and rocked at 4\\u2103 for 5 h. For collection of lung washing fluid, the trachea was exposed surgically and the oral portion of trachea was clamped, a 1-mL syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle was inserted into the trachea, 200\\u00b5L of PBS was injected into the peripheral airways, and five cycles of aspiration and injection were repeated [36] . After centrifugation at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min, supernatants of all samples were collected and stored at -80\\u00b0C before antibody detection.\\nThe anti-SARS-CoV titer of each sample was determined by ELISA.

The ability to induce a secretory (Fig. 3A) , whereas a 500-fold (p=0.002) and 10-fold (p=0.037) increase of sIgA titer could be induced when PIKA was coadministrated with antigen by intranasal and interperitoneal respectively. However, no specific sIgA titer could be detected in lung washing fluid (Fig.   3A ) although neutralizing activity could be detected in the lung (Fig. 2D) . One concern was how the the lung \\nWe also assayed the SARS-CoV specific IgG in the pooled mucosal samples as well as in the serum samples\\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 4 .

A parenterally administered viruslike particle even elicited 90% to 100% efficacy against infection and pre-invasive disease in previously uninfected individuals [15] .\\nFor determining correlation between neutralizing activity and antibody in serum and mucosal secretion, both IgG and IgA responses in serum and in mucosal secretion were tested. In our study, neutralizing activity was detected in lung samples from three groups of mice, in which only specific IgG but not IgA could be detected (Fig. 2-4) . Antibody analysis also indicated that it was specific IgG but not specific IgA response at mucosal sites that was correlated with neutralizing activity. It is very possible that mucosal IgG could also play an important role in contributing to the neutralizing activity at mucosal sites. It has been propose [41] , serum IgG induced in parenteral immunization could find its way to the mucosae to exert protective effects. The relatively high concentrations of IgG seen at particular mucosal sites may reflect a combination of constitutive transcellular or paracellular transport from the systemic compartment and specific transport mechanism [41] .\\nTherefore, detection of IgG response in mucosal sites is also useful for evaluation of mucosal immune response and related neutralizing activity.\\nBecause SARS-CoV infection occurs at mucosal surfaces, such as lung, digestive surfaces and even vaginal surface [20, 21, 26, 38, 40] , the induction of a neutralizing activity which could block virus attachment and infection is more important in SARS-CoV prevention. Our study showed that PIKA was effective at inducing neutralizing activity at mucosal sites when co-administered by intraperitoneal and intranasal immunization (Fig. 2) . Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA. This may partially result from certain loss of vaccine antigen, dilution by mucosal secretion, capture by mucus gels, attack by proteases and nucleases, or exclusion by epithelial cells when delivered through mucosal routes [30] .\\nHowever, it should be noted that intranasal immunization could induce much higher specific IgA responses than intraperitoneal immunization. Many studies already demonstrated that mucosal sIgA can inhibit viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular virus neutralization, and transepithelial transport of immune complexes [17, 28, 44] . Even rotavirus VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies that lack neutralizing activity can protect mice against infection by] rotavirus via an intracellular neutralization mechanism [5] . SARS-CoV-specific sIgA may also provide a similar kind of protection against SARS-CoV invasion at mucosal sites in the absence of classical neutralizing activities. If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.\\nThe adjuvanticity of PIKA may be mostly derived from its main component Poly(I:C). However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] . Takeshi [11] .\\nFor development and application of an adjuvant for human use, the priority is its safety. CT is the most potent known mucosal adjuvant, but it has adverse side effects, such as nasal discharge in humans. Here we determined the mucosal adjuvanticity of a new adjuvant, PIKA, which is a derivative of Poly(I:C).\\nPoly(I:C) itself is toxic to human and can be rapidly hydrolyzed despite its strong adjuvanticity [6] . PIKA is an improved adjuvant which was formulated as a [26] . All together, PIKA is well formulated as a stable and safe adjuvant.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of PIKA as an adjuvant can significantly raise the humoral immune response with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV in serum and mucosal sites. Therefore, PIKA is a good adjuvant candidate and can be also used as mucosal vaccine.\",\n          \"Abstract Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review. Virus capture/purification/concentration is critical in a number of biopharmaceutical and clinical applications. Validation of virus clearance is essential in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, in particular blood products (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; de Mendoza et al. 2012; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Shukla et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, large-scale, efficient purification schemes of viruses/ virus-like particles are required for the production of prophylactic vaccines and gene therapy vectors (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2006 Segura et al. , 2011 Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Virus inactivation technologies are commonly used to fulfil viral safety. They include physical (e.g., heat application, ultraviolet-and gamma irradiation) and chemical methods (e.g., solvent/detergent treatments) or their combination (e.g., exposure to photosensitizer plus UV light) (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Klein and Bryant 2009; Pelletier et al. 2006; Prowse 2013; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Solheim 2008) . Common methods for virus capture include filtration (Charcosset 2006; Grein et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) and chromatography in column or membrane configurations (Charcosset 2006; Gottschalk 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2013; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Segura et al. 2011 ). Viral filtration is usually the final purification step in the downstream processing of biopharmaceutical products, e.g., monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 1) , following one or more chromatography ''polishing'' steps that contribute to the overall virus removal efficiency of the process before concentration of the purified product. Filtration technologies are also extensively used for the capture and concentration of waterborne viral pathogens (Gibson 2014 ) from drinking, environmental, recreational or waste water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In addition, particulate air filters are used in personal respiratory protective equipment (i.e., face masks and respirators) Cohen and Birkner 2012; Rengasamy et al. 2004) to ensure shortrange protection of wearers against airborne pathogens-which include a number of viruses (Tang et al. 2006 )-and in air purifiers/cleaners to limit longrange aerosol transmission of infection in healthcare settings (Hyttinen et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2006) .\\nCellulosic membrane microfilters have been used routinely for ages in laboratories to perform the socalled ''sterile filtration'' (cold sterilization), i.e., the absolute removal of bacteria, yeasts and molds but not viruses (Walsh and Denyer 2012) from heat-sensitive liquid media. However, many virus filtration devices currently implemented are made from cellulose and its derivatives. Some eighty years ago, Gradocol, graded collodion (cellulose nitrate) membrane filters (Elford 1931; Bauer and Hughes 1934) have been extensively used in ultrafiltration to estimate the size of several medically important viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease (Galloway and Elford 1931) , vaccinia (Elford and Andrewes 1932) , herpes (Elford et al. 1933) , poliomyelitis (Elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza (Elford et al. 1936 ) (see also Ferry (1936) for an exhaustive review). Later on, commercial mixed cellulose ester filters with very low pore size, namely VF (virus fine), VM (virus medium) and VC (virus coarse) grade filters produced by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA-a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), have also been applied to virus ultrafiltration for grouping by size assessment (Hsiung 1965). As part of a series of papers surveying the antiviral applications of polysaccharide-based materials, the present review focuses on viral filtration using cellulosic filter media-most of which are commercially available products that have been extensively tested over the past twenty years for the removal/concentration/purification of viral particles from liquid samples, i.e., biopharmaceutical (namely blood products) and environmental (raw or treated) water samples. The application of cellulose-based filters in individual respiratory protective devices protecting the wearer against airborne viral pathogens is also detailed. Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for viral clearance or recovery/purification of viruses or virus-like particles will be presented elsewhere.\\nIn the processing of biological products, virus removal from the product stream while providing maximum product recovery is a critical task. It is more particularly difficult to eliminate small viral particles such as parvoviruses, which may contaminate blood products and mammalian cell cultures used in the production of recombinant proteins (Charcosset 2006) . Viral filters developed to answer this challenge are typically membrane (screen) filters ensuring a size-based rejection of viral particles via a sieving mechanism. Given the size of viruses, ranging roughly from 20 (Parvoviridae) to 400 nm (Poxviridae) (Segura et al. 2011) , viral filtration stands between microfiltration and ultrafiltration among pressure-driven filtration processes (Fig. 2) , though it is frequently but incorrectly (van Reis and Zydney 2007) classified as nanofiltration (Burnouf et al. 2005 ).\\n2.1 Regenerated cellulose hollow fiber (HF) membrane filters\\nCommon virus filtration membranes are made from poly(ethersulfone) (PES), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and regenerated cellulose (Burnouf and Radosevich 2003; Carter and Lutz 2002; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) . Among the latter, the commercial Planova TM filters (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) have been widely used to clear viruses from biologically produced pharmaceuticals, in particular blood products. Planova filters are composed of cuprammonium regenerated cellulose HF (Bemberg TM cupro fibers), prepared from cellulose cuprammonium spinning solution via microphase separation under precise spinning conditions (Tsurumi et al. 1990b, c) . The wall of each HF has a threedimensional web structure of pores consisting of large, bulky void pores interconnected by fine capillaries (Tsurumi et al. 1990a, b, c) (Fig. 3 ). During filtration, as the feed solution containing the product of interest is circulated through the HF bore, viruses accumulate in the large, bulky void pores of the fiber network while the product solution passes through the capillary pores. Since the HF wall is several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 4) , viruses are captured gradually inside the porous structure that can be considered multi-layered (100-200 layers) (Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006) . Hence, Planova filters behave like ''membrane depth filters'' (Walsh and Denyer 2012) operating on the basis of size exclusion. They offer a choice of 4 nominal mean pore sizes, namely 15 nm (15N), 19 nm (20N), 35 nm (35N) and 72 nm (75N)-the large pore 75N model being essentially used as a prefilter to remove impurities or aggregates prior to final virus filtration-and can be operated in normal (dead-end/flow through) or tangential flow (cross flow) filtration mode (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Planova filters have emerged to answer a publichealth problem of worldwide magnitude, i.e., blood contamination by HIV (Hamamoto et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1989 ) and hepatitis viruses (Yuasa et al. 1991; Sekiguchi et al. 1989 Sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . Table 1 gives examples of viral clearance studies assessing the capacity of Planova filters to remove viruses from blood products. In these viral clearance assays, product streams resulting from successive, scaleddown purification steps representative of the manufacturing process of the product (Kundu and Reindel 2007) , were artificially contaminated (''spiked'') with model viruses of different sizes (Table 2 ) (at much higher concentrations than what might be commonly found in the product intermediate) before being submitted to filtration. The virus removal efficiency of the filtration step was expressed as LRV (log reduction value, i.e., log ratio of the viral load in the spiked product feed stream to that recovered in the product filtrate), which implies that residual virus infectivity can never be reduced to zero but may be greatly reduced mathematically (ICH 1999) . Minimum LRV values were most frequently given. They were estimated when no viruses could be detected in filtered samples taking into account the detection limit of the assay (viral titer estimated as 1 infectious unit per sample volume). From the measured LRVs, the filtration operation is usually classified as effective (LRV [ 4), moderately effective (1 \\\\ LRV \\\\ 4) or Makino et al. (1994) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) ineffective (LRV \\\\ 1) (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Since filtration complements other viral clearance methods in the downstream processing of biotherapeutics (Brorson 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2007) , several studies quoted in Table 1 also report LRVs for common virus reduction steps such as inactivation by pasteurization (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007) or solvent/detergent treatment (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) , and chromatographic capture (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012) . Virus removal during the plasma fractionation process (Bryant and Klein 2007) leading from the crude plasma pool to the product (immunoglobulin here) stream has also been quantified (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) . Overall virus reduction factors obtained by addition of successive LRVs are given in these works, as illustrated by Table 3. In the virus spiking studies quoted in Table 1 , the actual viral filtration step was preceded by prefiltration to eliminate viral and/or protein aggregates that might be present in the spiked product solution. The presence of aggregated viruses may lead to overestimation of size exclusion effectiveness while contributing with protein aggregates to the fouling of viral filters, which reduces the membrane hydraulic permeability and may affect virus retention (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Pre-filtration was performed on the spikevirus stock suspension (Caballero et al. 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2010 ) on the product intermediate before virus inoculation (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012) , and/or on the virus Furuya et al. (2006) and Terpstra et al. (2006) CPV Canine parvovirus B19 V Gr\\u00f6ner ( and Terpstra et al. (2006 Terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spiked material (Chtourou et al. 2007; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006 Terpstra et al. , 2007 . For pre-filtration of the virus preparation, micro filters with a pore size adapted to the spike virus size, i.e., slightly lower than the virus size, were used to remove cell aggregates but not single viral particles-usual pore sizes ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 lm. Micro filters with 0.1-0.2 lm pore size (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007; , but also 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012 ) and 35N (Chtourou et al. 2007) . Planova viral filters were used to pre-filtrate the spiked product solution. In the latter work, the association in series of 35N and 15N filters led to efficient removal of small viruses such as PPV (Chtourou et al. 2007 ). This was not the case when 35N was used as the main viral filter after pre-filtration with 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) , which confirms previous date showing that the 35 nm pore size was too large to retain the smallest viral particles (Furuya et al. 2006; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006 ). Both 20N (Caballero et al. 2014; Furuya et al. 2006; Gr\\u00f6ner 2014) and 15N (Caballero et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2010; Terpstra et al. 2007; Planova filters and their combination (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012 ) showed effective virus removal over a wide range of viral particle sizes (Table 1) . As a general rule, the removal efficiency of the filters increased with the ratio of pore size to virus size, as illustrated by Gr\\u00f6ner (2014) and Terpstra et al. (2007) . This was also demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2010) by filtrating poliovirus type 1 (a picorvanirus) through Planova filters manufactured with different pore sizes, ranging between 15 (LRV = 6.9) and 35 nm (LRV = 0.2). The two-filter combinations were globally more efficient than single filters at removing small viruses from spiked protein intermediates, though two 15N filters connected in parallel for tangential filtration (Koenderman et al. 2012) yielded LRVs quite similar to those obtained using 15N alone (Terpstra et al. 2006 ). Care should be taken when comparing vertically the data collected in Table 1 , however. In addition to the sizes of viral particles and filter pores, the results of such virus-spiking studies are dependent on a number of process parameters such as the filtration operating conditions (filtration mode, transmembrane pressure, volume per filter area, tempera-ture\\u2026), the characteristics of the product feed stream (pH, conductivity, nature and concentration of the product\\u2026), or else the purity level and concentration of the virus spike. Moreover, several studies include pre-filtration (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) or viral inactivation (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) in the calculation of LRVs. This variability in test conditions for filtration-based virus removal makes difficult any comparison between LRVs collected from multiple sources as in Table 1 , even though some results (Caballero et al. 2014; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2010 ) contradict its influence on filtration performance, underlining the robustness of the filtration process. Also, some variations in virus removal capacity may occur between commercial filter modules owing to their manufacture from different batches of HF, as illustrated by Roberts et al. (2010) for 15N filters.\\nLike membrane microfiltration, depth filtration is widely used as a clarification step in biopharmaceutical purification to ensure removal of cell debris, large aggregates and contaminants from the product stream prior to purification processes such as column/membrane chromatography and viral filtration/inactivation steps (Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Vicente et al. Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Commercially available depth filters currently employed in bioprocessing are composed of cellulose fibers with a porous inorganic filter aid and a resin binder, generally cationic. For instance, the Zeta Plus TM filter media (3 M Purification Inc.-formerly Cuno, Meriden, CT, USA) is composed of a cellulose fiber depth matrix containing silica-based filter-aid material and positively charged by chemical bounding of a cationic charge modifier (Ostreicher 1991) .\\nVarying retention ratings are available (0.1-1.0 lm). The triple layered A1HC filter media from EMD Millipore include two depth filtration layers (cellulose ? diatomaceous earth) of different grades and a 0.1 lm-pore-size microporous membrane pre-filter made of mixed cellulose esters (van Reis and Zydney 2007). Hence, these cellulosic depth filters rely on both size exclusion and electrostatic adsorptive binding to effect separation (Liu et al. 2010) . In viral spiking studies (Barnette et al. 2012; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2008) , they were found to retain viral particles whose surface is negatively charged over a wide range of pH as their isoelectric points (pI) range most frequently between 3.5 and 7.0, with a mean value of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 (Michen and Graule 2010) .\\nViruses are recognized as a major cause of waterrelated disease (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) . Enteric viruses, more particularly, which are associated primarily with gastrointestinal illness (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) , are implied in most waterborne viral outbreaks (Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011 ). All types of water, including waters used for drinking (surface or ground supplies), recreational waters (fresh, marine, and swimming pool), agricultural waters for irrigation (rivers and groundwater) and waste waters (sewage or industrial effluents), have been shown to be potential vehicles for virus transmission (Bosch et al. 2008) .\\nContamination is most frequently of fecal origin (Bosch et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2012) . Although viral levels may be high at the contamination source, e.g., concentrations ranging between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particles per gram of feces are referred to in the literature (Michen and Graule 2010) , viral concentrations as low as 1-10 viral particles per liter may be found in environmental water (Julian and Schwab 2012) . Since enteric viruses display high infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Julian and Schwab 2012) , such titers may constitute a health risk and should be detected for reliable surveillance of viral pathogens in water. As a consequence, efficient concentration methods are needed to capture viruses in large-volume water samples and release the retained viral material in concentrated form. Most common methods are based on filtration processes (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In particular, virus adsorptionelution (viradel) filter methods have been widely implemented since the 1970s (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Briefly, in a viradel method, viruses from aqueous samples are reversibly adsorbed to microporous filters and then eluted from the filters in a small liquid volume (APHA, AWWA and WEF 1998). Adsorbent filters carry electrical charges and virus retention occurs via electrostatic interaction rather than by size exclusion. In other words, viradel filters act as depth filters rather than sieves. Contrary to viral filters that retain viruses by a sieving mechanism to achieve complete viral clearance, their pore size lies in the microporous range, which allows the high flow filtration necessary for virus capture in large water samples. Positively or negatively charged filters can be used in a viradel procedure, among which those made of cellulosic materials have been dominant over the last few decades.\\nSince their pI is below the pH of natural water (i.e., around neutrality) ( \\nHuang et al. (2000) Table 5 continued Filter type a Water nature No.\\n[0 tested earlier for concentration of viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 4 ). More recent studies made use of Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilters, however (Table 5 ). In these works, pure (e.g., distilled), tap, environmental or sewage water samples were seeded with varying enteric viruses that are common waterborne pathogens, i.e., members of the families Picornaviridae (polioviruses, coxsakieviruses, teschoviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses), Caliciviridae (noroviruses, caliciviruses) and Reoviridae (rotaviruses) (Fong and Lipp 2005) , or bacteriophages (enterobacteria phages) that are considered as alternative indicators of fecal contamination and as index organisms for the presence of enteric viruses in waters (Goodridge and Steiner 2012). Naturally contaminated waters containing sufficient levels of indigenous viruses, more particularly bacteriophages, were also used in addition to spiking studies sensu stricto (Table 4) . Following sample filtration, viral particles adsorbed to the filter were eluted in concentrated form using a variety of eluting solutions, the most common eluent consisting of a slightly alkaline (pH 9.0-9.5) protein solution (i.e., beef extract), frequently buffered with glycine-NaOH or another amino acid solution (sometimes supplemented with salt to aid disruption of electrostatic interactions between viruses and filters (Shields and Farrah 1983) , a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea) or a surfactant (e.g., Tween 80) to affect virus-filter hydrophobic interactions . Eluted viruses were quantified-using plaque titer assays, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recovery efficiency of the filtration step by comparing to input titers. This efficiency depends on a number of process parameters including the filter type and filtration conditions (e.g., filtration rate and pressure), the elution buffer composition and eluting conditions, the nature, input titer and titration method of the tested virus-in addition to the water matrix characteristics that may affect virus quantification and filter performance (Borchardt et al. 2013) . Hence, Tables 4 and 5 display a wide range of recovery yields. In practical tests aimed at the detection of naturallyoccurring viruses in field, large-volume water samples, the filtration (adsorption-elution) step is usually a primary concentration step which is followed by a secondary one to reach the virus detection threshold, e.g., organic flocculation or PEG precipitation (Lewis and Metcalf 1988) . The recovery yield of such two-step concentration processes was evaluated in several studies using seeded or naturally contaminated water samples (Tables 4, 5) . As a general rule, the viral loss due to secondary concentration was balanced by a huge increase in concentration factor allowing virus detection in water concentrates from large-volume samples, as reported by Chang et al. (1981) and Raphael et al. (1985) for indigenous enteroviruses in wastewater and rotaviruses in sewage-polluted surface water, respectively. After determining the optimal elution conditions for 1 MDS disk-adsorbed noroviruses following filtration of spiked distilled water samples, Lee et al. (2011) (Table 5 ) applied the optimized procedure to the detection of noroviruses in environmental water. They combined adsorptive filtration using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich viruses from largevolume surface (200 l) and ground (500 l) water samples. This integrated two-step process led to high volume reduction factors, i.e., 10,000 and 25,000 for surface and ground water samples, respectively (200-5009 for filtration, 509 for organic flocculation), but its recovery efficiency was not evaluated by spiking studies. In the same way, beside spiking Woo et al. (2012) . a Ratio of the virus survival factor in the treated filter to that in the untreated filter, where the virus survival factor in a filter is the number of viruses recovered by elution from the filter divided by the number of viruses removed by the filtration process. b PF PP filter from commercial surgical mask (DuPont TM 01361N), CCF coarse pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 54, 22 lm pore size), FCF fine pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50, 2.7 lm pore size) studies like those detailed in Table 5 , 1 MDS filter cartridges have been widely applied to concentrate enteric viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 6) , ranging from large-volume samples of weakly contaminated water intended for drinking or drinking water production (Borchardt et al. 2003 (Borchardt et al. , 2004 Lee et al. 2014; Sedmak et al. 2005; Verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewater samples with high viral content-to assess the virus removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Kuo et al. 2010; Simmons et al. 2011) . In these tests of field water samples for enteric viruses, 1 MDS filtration was mainly combined with second-stage concentration by organic flocculation as detailed by Fout et al. (2001) in the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) manual of methods for virology. The elution of filter-adsorbed viral particles was mostly performed with an alkaline beef extract solution supplemented or not with glycine (buffers EB3 and EB1 in Table 5 ). The work by Verheyen et al. (2009) is an exception to these common procedures. To concentrate viruses in small-volume samples from drinking water sources, these authors used two filter cartridges in series with no additional concentration step and an alkaline powdered milk solution as elution buffer. They found that 20% (3/15) and 13% (32/247) of surface and ground (well) water sources, respectively, were contaminated with adenoviruses, with very few samples positive to rotavirus (0/15 surface water samples, 6/247 well water sources). Despite the differences in virus concentration methods, these results compare with those obtained by Xagoraraki et al. (2007) and Cheong et al. (2009) for adenovirus detection in surface (14/58 samples, 24%) and ground water (4/29 samples, 14%), respectively. They also agree with data reported by Borchardt et al. (2003) and Cheong et al. (2009) showing the low contamination level of ground water by rotavirus. It is worth noting here, however, that the number of positive samples reported in these viral analyses of water (and the others quoted in Table 6 ) is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection techniques used to assess the presence of viruses, i.e., nucleic acid-based amplification methods such as conventional PCR, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR/RT-PCR or integrated cell culture PCR (ICC/PCR) to determine virus infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Hamza et al. 2011, Mattison and Bidawid 2009; Watzinger et al. 2006) with different detection thresholds.\\nIt emerges from this glance at literature that cellulose-based electropositive filters are still commonly used for viral monitoring of water. These filters are expensive, however, and face competition with cheaper products, in particular nanoalumina fiber filters and glass wool filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . The former, NanoCeram TM filters manufactured by Argonide Corporation (Sanford, Fla., USA), are composed of nanosized (2 nm diameter), alumina-based {mainly boehmite, c-AlO(OH)} fibrilles dispersed in a microglass fiber matrix, resulting in an electropositive filter media with 2-3 lm average pore size Kaledin 2005, 2006) . The latter consist of commercial sodocalcic glass wool coated with mineral oil (type Bourre 725 QN/TECH Loose Wool, Isover Saint-Gobain, Courbevois, France), hand packed into columns or filter holders in the laboratory (Vilagin\\u00e8s et al. 1993) . These glass wool filters harbor electropositive sites while presenting hydrophobic surface characteristics. Efficient enrichment of (seeded or/ and) indigenous viruses from various water samples using NanoCeram (Gibbons et al. 2010; Ikner et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2012) , and glass wool (Deboosere et al. 2011; Lambertini et al. 2008; Wyn-Jones et al. 2011 ) filters has been reported in recent years (see also Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . Compared with 1 MDS filters (Table 5) , NanoCeram filters showed similar , slightly lower (McMinn 2013) or higher (Karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentration efficiency.\\nCommercially available under different pore sizes (0.025-8.0 lm), mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are negatively charged over a wide range of pH values, their overall negative charge increasing with pH (Kessick and Wagner 1978) . Microporous filters in the 0.1-0.45 lm pore size range have been used for ages in laboratory and industry for size-based filtration of bacterial particles and cell debris (surface filters). These and larger pore size filters have been shown to retain enteroviruses, however, despite the much smaller size of viral particles compared to the nominal mean diameter of filter pores (Cliver 1968 ). The presence of salts enhanced virus adsorption to cellulose ester membranes, this effect increasing with the cation valence (i.e., Al 3? [ Mg 2? [ Na ? ) (Wallis et al. 1972) . Acidification of the viral suspension also improved virus adsorption efficiency, even in the absence of exogenously added salts (Sobsey et al. 1973 ). These early results were later confirmed by Lukasik et al. (2000) , who investigated the influence of mono-, di-, and trivalent salts (NaCl, MgCl 2 , and AlCl 3 ) on the adsorption of poliovirus and enterobacteria phages to the MF-Millipore TM membrane filter type HA (0.45 lm pore size) and the electropositive 3M TM Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilter at neutral or acidic pH. At pH 7, salts promoted virus adsorption to HA filter while affecting adsorption to 1 MDS filter. At pH 3.5, more than 95% of the viruses tested adsorbed to HA filter with or without salt added to the viral suspension-the salts interfering again with viral adsorption to 1MDS filter. Furthermore, the addition of urea or Tween 80 to the salt solution affected virus adsorption to both filters at pH 3.5 and HA filter at pH 7. In agreement with previous studies by the same group (Haramoto et al. 2004 (Haramoto et al. , 2005 Lukasik et al. (2000) explained these results by the antichaotropic effect of salts that increased hydrophobic interactions between filters and viruses and was impaired by the chaotropic agent or the detergent. At neutral pH, charge screeening by salt addition reduced electrostatic attractive and repulsive forces between viruses and 1 MDS or HA filter, respectively. Cation-mediated cross-complexation between negative groups on virus and filter surfaces (Kessick and Wagner 1978) and, more particularly, strengthened hydrophobic virusfilter interactions contributed to improving the adsorption efficiency of HA filter. At acidic pH, viruses displayed a positive surface charge and their electrostatic interactions with HA filter switched from repulsive to attractive-and inversely for electropositive 1 MDS filter. The presence of salt probably affected these interactions but was balanced by the promoting effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions.\\nHence, most tests reported so far for virus concentration from water samples using cellulose ester filters (essentially HA filters) have been performed after addition of multivalent cations (mainly Mg 2? ) to the water samples with or without pH adjustment to an acidic level. According to Katayama et al. (2002) , the virus-loaded filters were rinsed with an acidic solution to eliminate remaining cations before elution with NaOH or other alkaline buffers. Haramoto et al. (2004 Haramoto et al. ( , 2005 Haramoto et al. ( , 2007a proposed a variation in the method that consisted in pre-conditioning the filter with Al 3? ions. Aluminum chloride was passed through the filter, making an electropositive ion coating, which avoided cation addition to the water sample. The recovery efficiency of both protocols has been evaluated by seeding water samples with enteric viruses and bacteriophages and quantifying eluted viruses (Table 7) . Similarly to spiking studies (Tables 4, 5) and viral analyses of field water samples (Table 6 ) with electropositive filters, the HA-based filtration/elution process was frequently associated with a secondary concentration step to increase virus concentration factors. Here, centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) using commercial Millipore (Centriprep \\u00d2 , Centricon \\u00d2 or Amicon \\u00d2 ) concentrators was the elective concentration method. These CU units contain a low adsorptive regenerated cellulose membrane (Ultracel \\u00d2 ) whose nominal molecular-weight cutoff ranges between 3 and 100 kDa-a MWCO value of 50 kDa being most frequently selected for secondary concentration of eluted viruses. They are routinely used in laboratories to purify and concentrate biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids from small-volume biological samples (e.g., 2-15 ml for the Centriprep filter unit). Tested or not for virus recovery by spiking experiments, the combined concentration procedures have been extended to the detection of enteric viruses in field water samples including tap (Haramoto et al. 2004 ), sea (Katayama et al. 2002) , river (surface) (Fong et al. 2010; Hamza et al. 2009; Haramoto et al. 2005 ) and waste (Fong et al. 2010; Katayama et al. 2008 ) water (Table 8) . Samples with different volumes were collected according to the water source, i.e., sample volumes increased as the expected contamination level decreased. For instance, Katayama et al. (2002) applied HA filtration, followed by acid rinse of the filter, viral elution with NaOH and secondary concentration of the eluate by CU, to concentrate naturally occurring viruses (noroviruses, enteroviruses and HAV-hepatitis A virus) in seawater samples. Based on the volume reduction factor (2-l sample/2 ml final concentrate, i.e., 1000) and the recovery yield of the two-step process (Table 7) , a virus concentration factor of 670 was reached. Only HAV virus was not detected in any sample tested. Later on, Katayama et al. (2008) followed the same protocol to concentrate enteric viruses in the raw influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Samples of 100-ml volume were collected and submitted to the two-step concentration process, yielding a volume reduction factor of c. 140. The four tested kinds of enteric viruses were detected in all 72 wastewater samples but one lacking norovirus GI (NoV GI). Using PEG precipitation as the secondary concentration step, Hamza et al. (2009) tested river water samples for contamination by enteric viruses and bacteriophages. A volume reduction factor of 5000 (10-l sample/2 ml final concentrate) and virus concentration factors ranging between 1000 (norovirus) and 5000 (adenovirus) (see Table 7 for recovery yields) were obtained. All 41 analyzed samples were found positive for enteric viruses. Human adenovirus and norovirus were detected in 97.5 and 32% of the samples, respectively. Haramoto et al. (2004) illustrated the ability of Al 3? -coated filters to concentrate viruses from large-volume freshwater samples without salt addition by detecting noroviruses in tap water from Tokyo University. Tap water samples (303-l average volume) underwent two successive filtration/elution steps using 293-mm and 47-mm diameter HA filters prior to concentration by CU (final volume: 0.9 ml), which ensured a volume reduction factor higher than 300,000. However, the virus recovery efficiency of the 3-step concentration process was not evaluated. Ten of the 98 tested samples were found positive for noroviruses. These results compare to those reported by Lee et al. (2011) ( Table 5 ) using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich noroviruses from large surface and ground water samples.\\nDespite these promising data, the two viradel methods based on electronegative filters (i.e., addition of MgCl 2 to water samples or filter coating with Al 3? ions before filtration) have been essentially implemented for viral analysis of waters containing high amounts of indigenous viruses, requiring limited sample volumes (Table 8 )-electropositive filter cartridges being more adapted to virus concentration from large volumes of weakly contaminated water (Table 6 ). Beside the above-mentioned work by Haramoto et al. (2004) , only two studies among those detailed in Table 8 describe virus detection in environmental water samples with low viral content, namely drinking water sources after chlorination or without treatment (Rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwater from artesian wells (Chironna et al. 2012) . Both studies used small-volume samples and CU as secondary concentration step, yielding a modest volume reduction factor of 1000. Very few from 202 artesian well water samples were found positive to the tested enteric viruses: none for HAV and enterovirus, 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus (Chironna et al. 2012) . A large proportion (50%) of samples from drinkingwater supplies was positive to adenovirus, however (Rigotto et al. 2010) . These data are compatible with viral analyses of groundwater and water intended for drinking performed using 1 MDS filtration as the first virus concentration step (Table 6 ). It should be noted, however, that the same remark applies to data collected in Table 8 as to those in Table 6 concerning the numbers of virus-positive samples, i.e., their dependence on the virus detection method. This can be illustrated by the two following examples. Using ICC-PCR (measuring infectious viruses), Katayama et al. (2002) detected enteroviruses in 4 of 6 seawater samples from bathing beach, but no sample was found positive by direct RT-PCR. De Paula et al. (2007) found 48/52 river water samples positive for HAV by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, but only 12/52 by nested RT-PCR.\\nAs attested by the large body of literature data quoted above, virus adsorption-elution methods using electropositive or electronegative filters are routinely applied to the primary concentration of waterborne viruses, each type of filter possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. Ultrafiltration is considered another filtration-based option to concentrate viruses from water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). It has been indicated earlier that CU with microconcentrators based on cellulose ultrafiltration discs is commonly used as a secondary concentration step following the viradel process. Hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), however, is considered a potential technique for primary concentration of viruses from large-volume water samples, yielding better virus recoveries than the viradel method performed with either electropositive or electronegative filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Commercial HFUF devices operated in cross-flow mode have been applied to the simultaneous concentration of biological particles, including viruses, spiked in tap (Polaczyk et al. 2008) or reclaimed (Liu et al. 2012) water samples, to virus recovery from seeded tap (Rhodes et al. 2011 ) and estuarine (Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ) water samples, and also, more rarely, to virus recovery from field water samples (Grassi et al. 2010; Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ). Most of these devices are dialyzers that contain synthetic HF made from polysulfone. Following the early work by Belfort et al. (1976) showing that polysulfone HF membranes were superior to cellulose acetate ones for virus concentration, virus concentration experiments using HFUF dialyzers equipped with HF manufactured from cellulose are scarce. An example is given by Liu et al. (2012) . They showed that the Exeltra Plus 210 cellulose triacetate HF dialyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) and the Optiflux \\u00d2 F200NR polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Walthamm, MA, USA) provided similar recovery efficiencies for MS2 and UX174 bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from spiked 10-l and 100-l samples of reclaimed water.\\nAn array of viral infections can be transmitted by the airborne route, in particular via aerosols (droplet nuclei) Tang et al. 2006; Tellier 2006; Verreault et al. 2008 ). Even though virus inactivation rates in the atmosphere are generally higher than those of bacterial and fungal contaminants, virus-containing aerosols can spread worldwide (Despr\\u00e9s et al. 2012) . The threat of viral outbreaks and pandemics such as those caused by SARS coronavirus (Yu et al. 2004 ) and highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus (Tellier 2006) , allied with the fear of bioterrorism using viruses (e.g., smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses) (Barras and Greub 2014) as biological weapons, has encouraged the search for efficient protection equipment against aerosolized virus-containing particles.\\nIndividual respiratory protective devices consist in respirators, i.e., air-filtering face masks designed to protect the wearer against inhalation of a hazardous atmosphere (here airborne infectious aerosols)-opposing to surgical masks designed to protect the environment from contaminants generated by the wearer's exhaled breath (i.e., prevention of surgical infections) . Currently, most ''filtering facepiece'' (FFP) respirators have a multilayer composite structure with a central filtering layer displaying electret properties (Gralton and McLaws 2010) . These electret filters (Thakur et al. 2013) are produced by imparting an electrostatic charge to a nonwoven fibrous mat composed of synthetic polymer fibers such as poly(propylene) (PP) (mainly), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(carbonate) fibers. Electrostatic charging of the filter media is commonly obtained by corona discharge, triboelectrification and electrostatic spinning (Tsai et al. 2002) . Electret filters collect particles through the combined action of mechanical and electrostatic forces (Podg\\u00f3rski 2010; Wang 2001 (CEN 2000) should retain respectively at least 95 and 94% of influent particles (NaCl particles are used as nonbiological surrogate particles) (Rengasamy et al. 2009 ). First worn by surgical teams a hundred years ago to prevent bacterial contamination of patient's open wounds, early surgical masks were constructed from layers of cellulose materials, more particularly cotton cellulose (gauze) (Haller and Colwell 1918) and derivatives (Arnold 1938 ) (see also Belkin 1997) . Much more recently, face masks made from cotton fabrics have been tested as alternative respiratory protective equipment against pandemic outbreaks such as influenza (Dato et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2013; Rengasamy et al. 2010) . Like respirators, current commercially available surgical face masks include several layers of non-woven fabrics with, frequently, a cellulose inner layer in contact with the wearer's face to improve wearer's comfort. However, the filtering layer, usually made of meltblown fibers (Ghosh 2014) , is devoid of electret properties. Since particulate filtration is only mechanical, i.e., less efficient than that of respirators, most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices, standard tests to evaluate their filtration efficacy being less stringent (Oberg and Brosseau 2008) .\\nWhile a number of studies have confirmed that surgical masks logically offer lower protection than respirators against aerosol particles, the effectiveness of both types of face masks at preventing viral respiratory infection, in particular influenza, is still a matter of controversy (Bin-Reza et al. 2012; Cowling et al. 2010; Gralton and McLaws 2010) . The improper facial fit of respirators Coia et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protection efficiency against infectious aerosols. It allows particulate flows outside the filtration area of the mask, resulting in face-seal leaks, i.e., the leakage of infectious particles around the edges of the mask (Grinshpun et al. 2009; Lei et al. 2013) . Mask seal leakage can be minimized by applying existing guidelines for correct donning and fit checking of respirators . Moreover, human face and head form models have been proposed as a tool for designing respirators with improved protection efficiency, simulating interactions between faces and facemasks and describing their fit (Golshahi et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2012) . The accumulation of viral particles at the surface and within the filtration media of respirators, where they can remain viable and infectious for extended periods of time (Coulliette et al. 2013; Sakaguchi et al. 2010) , is another significant problem with which respirator wearers are confronted in the prevention of viral transmission and spread. Incorrect mask handling by the wearer may lead to accidental self-inoculation, cross-contaminations affecting both other healthcare workers and patients, and contamination of fomites (Casanova et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the risk of virus reaerosolization from respirators during extended use, if limited, cannot be ruled out (Fisher et al. 2012) . Recommendations for respirator doffing do exist but have proven insufficient to prevent virus transfer from respirator to healthcare employees' hands and clothing (Casanova et al. 2008) . Adding antiviral properties to the filtration process may contribute to limit the risk of viral transmission by improper handling of used respirators. A number of virucidal facemasks have been developed and patented over the past 15 years (Tiliket et al. 2011) , some of which are commercially available. In the SpectraShield TM Plus respirator masks designed by Nexera Medical Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) (Haas 2008), for instance, two layers of filter media are sandwiched between (inner and outer) antimicrobial layers where a silver-copper zeolite (carrier) antimicrobial agent (Agion \\u00d2 antimicrobial, Sciessent LLC, Wakefield, Mass.) is embedded around the core of synthetic fibers (Fosshield \\u00d2 , Foss Manufacturing, Hampton, NH). The Biofriend TM Biomask TM FFP respirator, manufactured by Filligent Ltd. (Hong Kong) and distributed by Medline Industries, Inc. (Mundelein, Ill.) , is another four-layered device in which the melt-blown PP filtration layer is inserted between an inner layer of spunbond PP and two antiviral layers, namely a cellulose/polyester layer containing copper and zinc ions and an outer layer of spunbond PP treated with a low pH (citric acidacidified) hydrophilic plastic coating (Davison 2012; Stewart et al. 2014) . The outer layer absorbs infectious aerosol droplets and viruses are denaturated by exposure to citric acid. In the second layer, inactivation of viruses with damaged structures is completed by the virucidal effect of divalent metal cations. Contributing to the overall antiviral efficiency of the structure, the cellulosic component of this layer is a sulphated or sulfonated rayon fabric (Stewart et al. 2012 (Stewart et al. , 2014 to which a variety of viral human pathogens bind via the cationic sites of viral envelopes/capsids.\\nBeside the commercial Biomask TM respirator, various composite structures designed for filtrationinactivation of airborne microbial contaminants, where cellulosic materials play an active antimicrobial role, have been patented in recent years Bernard 2006; Nakamura and Nakamura 2011; Tsutsumi 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhong 2011) . Several of them are based on bacterial cellulose layers/coatings provided with an antimicrobial component, i.e., silver (Zhong 2011) or zeolite-supported silver (Nakamura and Nakamura 2011) nanoparticles, and chitosan (Zhang et al. 2012) . The respiratory protective mask described by Zhong (2011) comprises a three-layer bacterial cellulose membrane whose middle layer contains silver nanoparticles. The antimicrobial facemask invented by Nakamura and Nakamura (2011) includes two base cloth elements both of which are made of a woven textile (gauze), a nonwoven cellulose fabric (e.g., rayon), or a porous sheet (e.g., a 0.3-0.5 mm sliced sheet of urethane sponge). The first base cloth is filled with bacterial cellulose nanofibers that retain silver zeolite and a humectant (e.g., trehalose or 1,3-butylene glycol) in their network structure. Additional antimicrobial properties are provided to the mask by impregnating the second base cloth with a carboxylic acid (e.g., citric acid). Zhang et al. (2012) also used bacterial cellulose in a composite antimicrobial material suitable for respiratory protective masks. A nonwoven polymer fabric Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) 16:455-489 479 was coated with a film of bacterial cellulose mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improve the film-forming properties, mechanical strength and air permeability of the coating-and chitosan, a non-sulfated polysaccharide produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin that displays strong antibacterial potency (Kong et al. 2010; Rabea et al. 2003 ) and, to a lesser extent, antiviral activity (Rabea et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2012 ).\\nIn the antimicrobial air filtration device proposed by Bernard (2006) , cellulose derivatives-more particularly, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common pharmaceutical excipient for enteric coating of tablets and capsules with antiviral activity (Pirrone et al. 2011 )-were used as ''biocidal prophylactic compounds'' to provide the classical filter media (e.g., a nonwoven PP web, electrostatically charged or not) with antimicrobial properties. Cellulose derivatives could be incorporated as fibers or particles (micronized fibers) into the air filtration device either in a separate layer positioned before or after the filter media, or deposited onto the outer surface of the filter media relative to the air flow direction. To illustrate this invention, handsheets prepared from CAP fibers intermixed or not with CAP particles were successfully tested for virucidal efficacy by exposure to an aerosol challenge of enterobacteria phage \\u00d8X174.\\nBy exploiting the antimicrobial properties of dialdehyde polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose dialdehydes, Baney et al. (2012) proposed a new method for producing low-cost virucidal filters suitable for respiratory protective masks. The treatment of a standard cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50 filter paper) with sodium periodate improved its antiviral potency due to oxidation of some cellulose to dialdehyde cellulose inside the filter. Challenged with aerosols of MS2 enterobacteria phage at high relative humidity (90% at 23\\u00b0C), the treated filter showed higher filtration efficiency than a control, untreated one, i.e., better removal of viable viral particles (Plaque Forming Units) joined to a lower resistance to air flow (pressure drop)-due to increased pore size distribution (Woo et al. 2011) . Higher inactivation of MS2 virus by the treated filter was also highlighted, confirming an improvement of its disinfection capability (Woo et al. 2011 ). However, the filtration and inactivation of airborne viruses were less effective at lower moisture content of the filter, i.e., at air humidity levels commonly encountered in hospital settings, in particular operating rooms (Balaras et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, the inhalation resistance of the treated filter remained too high for application to respiratory protective masks. The same pros and cons apply to cellulose paper filters treated by immersion into aqueous suspensions of dialdehyde starch (DAS) (Woo et al. 2012) . While this treatment did not affect the removal efficiency of viable MS2 viruses from aerosols at high relative humidity, virus survival on the treated filters was reduced (Fig. 5 ) and the pressure drop decreased as DAS concentration increased. The drop in air flow resistance remained insufficient for practical application to respirators. DAS treatment of a PP filter from a commercial FFP mask did not modify the filtration parameters (virus removal efficiency and pressure drop) of the filter but significantly improved its biocidal efficacy (Fig. 5 )-an opening of this treatment towards the development of virucidal facemasks. Another example of cellulose filter material treated with cellulose derivatives to yield antiviral properties is given by Tsurumi (Tsutsumi 2009 ). This inventor devised a low-cost virucidal mask filter made of a standard cellulose nonwoven fabric impregnated with water extracts of sulfonated or aminated styrenegraft cellulose. To reinforce the water retention properties of the filter media, a superabsorbent resin such as poly(acrylic acid) was added to the graft cellulose extract before impregnation of the fabric or incorporated into a separate layer covering the impregnated fabric. Low (hydrogen ions from sulfonic acid groups) or high (hydroxyl ions generated by aminated groups) pH conditions inside the hydrated material were claimed to make it virucidal against influenza A virus and caliciviruses. The patent gives no illustration of such antiviral properties, however.\\nStudies published by Tiliket et al. (2011) and Catel-Ferreira et al. (2015) present another type of cellulosebased material for airborne virus filtration in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulose material, i.e., commercial Kimwipes \\u00d2 (KW) wipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., Dallas, Tex.), was chemically modified by coating with a synthetic polymer, i.e., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Tiliket et al. 2011) or grafting of an antiviral agent, i.e., catechin (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) . The filtration efficiency of the modified filter media was first tested on aerosolized T4D viruses (Enterobacteria phage T4, Doermann's strain T4D). Then the treated filter was inserted inside a commercial medical mask in place of its cellulosic layer (Kolmi M24001 mask, Kolmi-Hopen, Saint-Barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'Anjou, France), and the reconstructed mask was challenged with TD4 aerosols to evaluate its virus removal efficiency. Both treatments significantly improved the virus capture factor (ratio of upstream to downstream PFU contents) of KW cellulose wipes and of reconstructed commercial masks compared to original masks and to masks reconstructed with untreated wipes. In these studies, the breathability of reconstructed masks was not quantified, nor was the virus survivability on the modified filter media. However, additional filtration experiments using aerosols of influenza A virus (low pathogenic H5N2 strain) showed that challenged viral particles accumulated in PEI functionalized KW layers with no loss in number and infectivity (Tiliket et al. 2011) . Thus these modified masks showed no virucidal effect, the PEImodified layers behaving like an electret media owing to the polycationic character of PEI. On the other hand, since catechin and catechin-grafted wipes showed antiviral activity against T4D viruses in liquid media (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) , it may be assumed that part of viruses accumulated in excess in the treated wipes were inactivated by the polyphenol agent, i.e., the reconstructed masks were actually virucidal.\\nDespite these few examples, the use of cellulosic media in filtration devices aimed at the capture of airborne viral particles remains now very limited compared to filtration of virus-contaminated liquid samples. While patented, several cellulose-based, virucidal filter media designed for insertion in air filtering face masks have not been commercially developed yet.\\nBesides the wearing of personal respiratory protective equipment, another aspect of the fight against airborne infections lies in the decontamination of indoor air in healthcare facilities, and, more generally, of air processed through heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the built environment. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are the primary technology used for particulate removal in these collective protection devices-allied with UV irradiation, ozonation or air ionization to yield indoor air decontamination (Bolashikov and Melikov 2009; Jacob et al. 2013 )-and may be complemented with a photytocatalyst such as TiO 2 to improve the inactivation of accumulated microorganisms Pigeot-Remy et al. 2014 ). Since HEPA filters are essentially made of glass fibers, they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retentive properties will not be detailed further.\\nMost frequently associated with other virus reduction (virus clearance of biopharmaceuticals) or concentration (viral analysis of water) steps, size-exclusion and/ or adsorptive (charge mediated) filtration is an essential tool to fight against viral contaminants in aqueous media. Owing to inherent properties of cellulose, including mechanical strength and hydrophilicity (that opposes protein adsorption and biofouling), allied with widespread availability and biocompatibility, cellulose-based materials are still widely present in viral filters. Developed commercially over the past thirty years, several cellulosic filter media have been and continue to be used for both routine analyses in laboratories and academic research studies aimed at improving the filtration performance, generating a wealth of data quantifying the efficiency of virus removal or recovery/concentration from biologic or water samples, respectively.\\nAs concerns biopharmaceutical compounds, these data arise from validation studies of the filtration step performed by spiking intermediate biologic solutions (mostly blood proteins) from multistage purification processes with known titers of viral particles. Regenerated cellulose HF Planova filters N15-N35, operated in the dead-end mode as a single filter or two units in series, were shown to provide LRV values ranging between 4 and 7, on the average. Increasingly tested since their launching in 1989, these cellulosic filters compete with filter media made of synthetic polymers such as PVDF (e.g., Viresolve \\u00d2 NFP-Normal Flow Parvovirus-from EMD Millipore; Ultipor \\u00d2 VF Grade DV20/DV50 from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) or PES (e.g., Millipore Viresolve \\u00d2 Pro; Virosart \\u00d2 HS/HC/CPV from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). The hydrophilic nature of cellulose fibers is a definite advantage of Planova filters over others for virus removal from protein solutions, minimizing flux decline due to proteindominated filter plugging (cake formation) at constant pressure (normal-flow) filtration (Rathore et al. 2014 ). However, they are usually operated at lower flow rate than filters made of synthetic polymers whose operating pressure is higher. Hydrophilic modified PVDF membrane filters designed for virus removal from high-concentration protein solutions at high flow rate are being developed by several manufacturers, including Asahi-Kasei (i.e., Planova TM BioEX filters, launched in 2009).\\nMany studies have also been reported to assess the virus concentration efficiency of the viradel method using spiked water samples, prior to the detection of waterborne viral contaminants in field water samples. In this method, cellulosic filters, whether positively or negatively charged, are used for adsorptive capture of viruses before virus recovery by elution with a lowvolume eluent. Electropositive filters are more particularly suitable for virus capture in low-contaminated, high-volume water samples, e.g., samples of groundwater or source water for drinking water production ( Table 6) . Though routinely used, these filters are expensive and face competition with nanoalumina fiber filters (e.g., the patented Ahlstrom Disruptor \\u00d2 electroadsorptive filter) (Levi 2011 ) and glass wool filters, which are cheaper. On the other hand, efficient virus adsorption by electronegative filters-the standard, cost-effective mixed cellulose ester membrane microfilters-requires impractical sample pre-treatment: their use is limited to viral analysis of highlycontaminated waters, for which small-volume samples are sufficient (Table 8) .\\nCellulose nanomaterials may represent a promising perspective for cellulosic materials in their application to viral filtration of liquid samples, yielding filtration membranes with higher mechanical strength, water permeability, surface hydrophilicicy and resistance to biofouling (Carpenter et al. 2015) . Ma et al. (2011) have presented a composite membrane consisting of an electrospun poly(acrylonitrile) nanofibrous scaffold deposited on a non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) support. This two-layered membrane was coated by a layer of cellulose nanofibers and tested for retention of MS-2 phages. At acidic pH, phage particles were adsorbed by the negatively charged cellulose nanofiber coating, yielding a LRV value [3.7. Later on, the same nanofibrous composite membrane was doped with cellulose nanofibers functionalized by grafting with poly(vinylamine) . MS-2 phages were adsorbed at neutral pH onto positively charged amino-modified nanofibers, with a LRV value of 4. Metreveli et al. (2014) and Asper et al. (2015) have presented a size-exclusionbased filter paper made of pure cellulose nanofibers for removal of swine influenza A and murine leukemia viruses, respectively. These non-woven materials could be tailored to ensure efficient virus retention (Gustafsson and Mihranyan 2016a). Self assembled into nanosheets to yield ''mille feuille'' structures, they showed efficient removal of parvoviruses (Gustafsson et al. 2016b) : maybe a new filtration media for viral clearance?\\nA number of air filtration devices designed for individual protection against airborne viruses also include cellulosic materials. While published data on the filtration performance of cellulosic media for removal of viruses from air are scarce, industrial research is more apparent, in particular in Asian countries (China, Japan) where airborne pollution is a matter of great concern-the main objective being to add virucidal properties to the filtration media so as to inactivate accumulated viral particles. Therefore, some innovative media have been patented over the past few years with, however, no commercial development to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1405,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Radoshevich, Lilliana.

report suggest that a wide rang of humor immun in system and divers mucos surfac may play an import role in vaccine-induc protect against sars-cov transmiss . \\n mucos immun play an import role in prevent of invas by pathogen , which could be induc via system or mucos immun . \\n howev , both immun protocol requir an effect adjuv to produc better immun respons . \\n mucos deliv antigen in the absenc of an adjuv usual induc either a low or undetect antigen-specif immun respons or result in immun toler [ 7 , 43 ] . at present , a few mucos vaccin have been approv for human use in the unit

against influenza virus [ 3 ] . it is becom increas appar that an effect mucos adjuv is a high prioriti in the develop of effici mucos vaccin . \\n a synthet dsrna , term poly(i : c ) , has been found be abl to boost immun respons sinc the 1960s [ 10 , 45 ] . recent , poly(i : c ) was discov to function as an adjuv through it interact with tlr3 , which in turn activ the nf-\\u03bab pathway , result in stabl matur of dcs , activ of nk cell and longer-tim surviv of activ cd4 + t cell in vitro [ 42 ] . ichinoh et al. [ 11 ] report that intranas vaccin of hemaglutinin ( ha ) adjuv with poly(i : c ) can induc protect against influenza viral infect in mice . brian r. sloat also show that nasal immun with anthrax pa plus poly(i : c ) can enhanc the product of mucos and system immun [ 34 ] . therefor , poly(i : c ) repres anoth potenti adjuv . howev , poly(i : c ) itself is unsuit as a potenti adjuv becaus it is toxic and can be rapid hydrolyz in human when use alon [ 6 ] . sever poly(i : c ) deriv have been suggest , such as poly(iclc ) , which is poli ( i : c ) contain poly-l-lysin and carboxymethylcellulos [ 2 ] , to minim observ defici of poli ( i : c ) . \\n pika is a particular deriv of poli ( i : c ) compris kanamycin and calcium chlorid [ 25 ] specif igg and ifn-\\u03b3 respons in mice [ 33 ] . most recent studi also show that pika can provid broad-spectrum prophylaxi against a number of influenza a virus and coadministr of pika with a poor immunogen h5n1 subunit vaccin can lead to antigen spare and quantit and qualit improv of the immun respons over those achiev with an unadjuv vaccin in mice [ 18 , 19 ] . \\n in the present studi , we demonstr that the intraperiton and intranas co-administr of this \\n product [ 24 ] was inactiv with formaldehyd . pika is an improv adjuv formul compris a deriv of poly(i : c ) , kanamycin and calcium chlorid [ 23 , 33 ] , which was manufactur in complianc with good manufactur practic by newbiom pika pte ltd , singapor . \\n femal balb/c mice , 6 to 8 week of age , were purchas from hubei cdc and maintain in spf environ throughout the experi . the mice were immun through either an intranas ( i.n . ) or intraperiton ( i.p . ) rout with 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov or 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov plus the indic dose of pika . mice immun with pbs serv as a negat control . the protocol for intranas immun requir the mice to be anesthet slight with sodium pentobarbit and held invert with nose up until droplet of vaccin that were appli to both extern nare were complet inhal [ 13 ] . all intranas immun reagent were suspend with pbs . individu mice receiv 10 \\u00b5l of inocul for five time with a 30 min rest interv between inocul ( total volum , 50 \\u00b5l ) . for intraperiton immun , vaccin composit were adjust with pbs to a consist 200 \\u00b5l dose . each mous receiv three immun with a 2-week interv between each immun . \\n all sampl were collect two week after the final immun as previous describ [ 9 ] . blood sampl were collect by retro-orbit plexus punctur . saliva was obtain after intraperiton inject with 20 \\u00b5g of carbamylcholin chlorid . the vagin tract of individu mice was wash with 30\\u00b5l pbs for three time , with a total volum of 90\\u00b5l. after remov fece , small intestin tissu were weigh , cut into small piec , mix with pbs ( 100 mg of small intestin in 200\\u00b5l of pbs ) , and rock at 4 \\u2103 for 5 h. for collect of lung wash fluid , the trachea was expos surgic and the oral portion of trachea was clamp , a 1-ml syring equip with a 22-gaug needl was insert into the trachea , 200\\u00b5l of pbs was inject into the peripher airway , and five cycl of aspir and inject were repeat [ 36 ] . after centrifug at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min , supernat of all sampl were collect and store at -80 \\u00b0 c befor antibodi detect . \\n the anti-sars-cov titer of each sampl was determin by elisa . the specif antibodi in \\n the neutral test was carri out with pseudotyp sars-cov produc as qu et al. \\n describ previous with a slight modif [ 31 ] . \\n the western blot assay was carri out accord to the protocol in molecular clone [ 32 ] . briefli , a segment of spike ( s ) protein ( 401~750aa ) of sars-cov , which was express in vitro and name s ' [ 27 ] , was separ by sds-page on a 5 % stack polyacrylamid gel in combin with a 12 % separ gel . \\n the separ protein were then transfer to a nitrocellulos membran for 2 h with a 300 ma current . after block with 3 % bsa in pbs for 2 h at \\n the statist signific of the differ between group was calcul by student 's t-test for two group or by tukey 's test use anova for three or more group . differ were consid not signific when p>0.05 . \\n the optim concentr of the pika adjuv was identifi by immun mice intraperiton or intranas with 50 \\u00b5g , 100 \\u00b5g , or 250 \\u00b5g of pika mix with 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov antigen . [ 17 , 44 ] . the abil to induc a secretori ( fig. 3a ) , wherea a 500-fold ( p=0.002 ) and 10-fold ( p=0.037 ) increas of siga titer could be induc when pika was coadministr with antigen by intranas and interperiton respect . howev , no specif siga titer could be detect in lung wash fluid ( fig.    3a ) although neutral activ could be detect in the lung ( fig. 2d ) . one concern was how the the lung \\n we also assay the sars-cov specif igg in the pool mucos sampl as well as in the serum sampl \\n the result are summar in fig. 4 . pika could increas a specif igg respons in intestin , saliva , vagina and lung ( fig. 4a , black bar ) were determin in dilut sampl use elisa . each bar repres the arithmet mean titer of individu group \\u00b1 se . the statist signific of the differ between group was calcul by use transform data ( log2 ) of elisa mean titer by student 's t-test for two group , or by tukey 's test use anova for three or more group . ag , 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov alon ; \\n ag+pika , 10 \\u00b5g of inactiv sars-cov plus 100 \\u00b5g of pika . this approach could help to elicit hiv immunogen specif iga and igg respons in vagin , fecal and saliva sampl [ 4 ] . a parenter administ viruslik particl even elicit 90 % to 100 % efficaci against infect and pre-invas diseas in previous uninfect individu [ 15 ] . \\n for determin correl between neutral activ and antibodi in serum and mucos secret , both igg and iga respons in serum and in mucos secret were test . in our studi , neutral activ was detect in lung sampl from three group of mice , in which onli specif igg but not iga could be detect ( fig. 2 - 4 ) . antibodi analysi also indic that it was specif igg but not specif iga respons at mucos site that was correl with neutral activ . it is veri possibl that mucos igg could also play an import role in contribut to the neutral activ at mucos site . it has been propos [ 41 ] , serum igg induc in parenter immun could find it way to the mucosa to exert protect effect . the relat high concentr of igg seen at particular mucos site may reflect a combin of constitut transcellular or paracellular transport from the system compart and specif transport mechan [ 41 ] . \\n therefor , detect of igg respons in mucos site is also use for evalu of mucos immun respons and relat neutral activ . \\n becaus sars-cov infect occur at mucos surfac , such as lung , digest surfac and even vagin surfac [ 20 , 21 , 26 , 38 , 40 ] , the induct of a neutral activ which could block virus attach and infect is more import in sars-cov prevent . our studi show that pika was effect at induc neutral activ at mucos site when co-administ by intraperiton and intranas immun ( fig. 2 ) . intranas immun appear less effect than intraperiton immun at elicit neutral activ , even when adjuv with pika . this may partial result from certain loss of vaccin antigen , dilut by mucos secret , captur by mucus gel , attack by proteas and nucleas , or exclus by epitheli cell when deliv through mucos rout [ 30 ] . \\n howev , it should be note that intranas immun could induc much higher specif iga respons than intraperiton immun . mani studi alreadi demonstr that mucos siga can inhibit viral infect via immun exclus , intracellular virus neutral , and transepitheli transport of immun complex [ 17 , 28 , 44 ] . even rotavirus vp6-specif iga monoclon antibodi that lack neutral activ can protect mice against infect by ] rotavirus via an intracellular neutral mechan [ 5 ] . sars-cov-specif siga may also provid a similar kind of protect against sars-cov invas at mucos site in the absenc of classic neutral activ . if this is true , the in vitro neutral activ may onli reflect partial correl with the protect effect of immun respons . \\n the adjuvant of pika may be most deriv from it main compon poly(i : c ) . howev , the adjuv mechan of poly(i : c ) is not clear understood yet although it is believ to be relat with to dsrna structur and tlr3 mediat immun respons . in-vivo , the presenc of viral dsrna can trigger cellular immun respons to viral infect through the activ of dsrna-depend enzym includ pkr , and the ifn-induc 2'-5'-adenyl synthase/rnas l system [ 12 , 16 ] . in addit , mammalian tlr3 's can recogn viral dsrna , lead to the activ of nf-\\u03bab and the product of type 1 interferon which can serv as a bridg between the innat and adapt immun system [ 1 ] . takeshi [ 11 ] . \\n for develop and applic of an adjuv for human use , the prioriti is it safeti . ct is the most potent known mucos adjuv , but it has advers side effect , such as nasal discharg in human . here we determin the mucos adjuvant of a new adjuv , pika , which is a deriv of poly(i : c ) . \\n poly(i : c ) itself is toxic to human and can be rapid hydrolyz despit it strong adjuvant [ 6 ] . pika is an improv adjuv which was formul as a [ 26 ] . all togeth , pika is well formul as a stabl and safe adjuv . \\n in summari , we have demonstr that both intraperiton and intranas administr of pika as an adjuv can signific rais the humor immun respons with neutral activ against sars-cov in serum and mucos site . therefor , pika is a good adjuv candid and can be also use as mucos vaccin .\",\n          \"abstract viral filtrat is a critic step in the purif of biolog and in the monitor of microbiolog water qualiti . viral filter are also essenti protect element against airborn viral particl . the present review first focus on cellulosebas filter media current use for size-exclus and/or adsorpt filtrat of virus from biopharmaceut and environment water sampl . data from spike studi quantifi the viral filtrat perform of cellulos filter are detail , i.e. , first , the virus reduct capac of regener cellulos hollow fiber filter in the manufactur process of blood product and , second , the effici of virus recovery/concentr from water sampl by the viradel ( virus adsorption-elut ) method use charg modifi , electroposit cellulos filter or convent electroneg cellulos ester microfilt . viral analysi of field water sampl by the viradel techniqu is also survey . this review then describ cellulose-bas filter media use in individu protect equip against airborn viral pathogen , present innov filtrat media with virucid properti . some pros and con of cellulos viral filter and perspect for cellulose-bas materi in viral filtrat are underlin in the review . virus capture/purification/concentr is critic in a number of biopharmaceut and clinic applic . valid of virus clearanc is essenti in the manufactur of therapeut protein , in particular blood product ( bryant and klein 2007 ; klamroth et al. 2014 ; de mendoza et al. 2012 ; radosevich and burnouf 2010 ; shukla et al. 2007 ) . on the other hand , large-scal , effici purif scheme of viruses/ virus-lik particl are requir for the product of prophylact vaccin and gene therapi vector ( rodrigu et al. 2007 ; segura et al. 2006 segura et al. , 2011 vicent et al. 2011a , b ) . virus inactiv technolog are common use to fulfil viral safeti . they includ physic ( e.g. , heat applic , ultraviolet-and gamma irradi ) and chemic method ( e.g. , solvent/deterg treatment ) or their combin ( e.g. , exposur to photosensit plus uv light ) ( bryant and klein 2007 ; klamroth et al. 2014 ; klein and bryant 2009 ; pelleti et al. 2006 ; prows 2013 ; radosevich and burnouf 2010 ; solheim 2008 ) . common method for virus captur includ filtrat ( charcosset 2006 ; grein et al. 2013 ; liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ) and chromatographi in column or membran configur ( charcosset 2006 ; gottschalk 2008 ; liu et al. 2010 ; orr et al. 2013 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ; segura et al. 2011 ) . viral filtrat is usual the final purif step in the downstream process of biopharmaceut product , e.g. , monoclon antibodi ( fig. 1 ) , follow one or more chromatographi '' polish '' step that contribut to the overal virus remov effici of the process befor concentr of the purifi product . filtrat technolog are also extens use for the captur and concentr of waterborn viral pathogen ( gibson 2014 ) from drink , environment , recreat or wast water sampl ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; ikner et al. 2012 ) . in addit , particul air filter are use in person respiratori protect equip ( i.e. , face mask and respir ) cohen and birkner 2012 ; rengasami et al. 2004 ) to ensur shortrang protect of wearer against airborn pathogens-which includ a number of virus ( tang et al. 2006 ) -and in air purifiers/clean to limit longrang aerosol transmiss of infect in healthcar set ( hyttinen et al. 2011 ; tang et al. 2006 ) . \\n cellulos membran microfilt have been use routin for age in laboratori to perform the socal '' steril filtrat '' ( cold steril ) , i.e. , the absolut remov of bacteria , yeast and mold but not virus ( walsh and denyer 2012 ) from heat-sensit liquid media . howev , mani virus filtrat devic current implement are made from cellulos and it deriv . some eighti year ago , gradocol , grade collodion ( cellulos nitrat ) membran filter ( elford 1931 ; bauer and hugh 1934 ) have been extens use in ultrafiltr to estim the size of sever medic import virus such as foot-and-mouth diseas ( galloway and elford 1931 ) , vaccinia ( elford and andrew 1932 ) , herp ( elford et al. 1933 ) , poliomyel ( elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza ( elford et al. 1936 ) ( see also ferri ( 1936 ) for an exhaust review ) . later on , commerci mix cellulos ester filter with veri low pore size , name vf ( virus fine ) , vm ( virus medium ) and vc ( virus coars ) grade filter produc by millipor ( billerica , ma , usa-a subsidiari of merck kgaa , darmstadt , germani ) , have also been appli to virus ultrafiltr for group by size assess ( hsiung 1965 ) . as part of a seri of paper survey the antivir applic of polysaccharide-bas materi , the present review focus on viral filtrat use cellulos filter media-most of which are commerci avail product that have been extens test over the past twenti year for the removal/concentration/purif of viral particl from liquid sampl , i.e. , biopharmaceut ( name blood product ) and environment ( raw or treat ) water sampl . the applic of cellulose-bas filter in individu respiratori protect devic protect the wearer against airborn viral pathogen is also detail . polysaccharide-bas chromatograph adsorb for viral clearanc or recovery/purif of virus or virus-lik particl will be present elsewher . \\n in the process of biolog product , virus remov from the product stream while provid maximum product recoveri is a critic task . it is more particular difficult to elimin small viral particl such as parvovirus , which may contamin blood product and mammalian cell cultur use in the product of recombin protein ( charcosset 2006 ) . viral filter develop to answer this challeng are typic membran ( screen ) filter ensur a size-bas reject of viral particl via a siev mechan . given the size of virus , rang rough from 20 ( parvovirida ) to 400 nm ( poxvirida ) ( segura et al. 2011 ) , viral filtrat stand between microfiltr and ultrafiltr among pressure-driven filtrat process ( fig. 2 ) , though it is frequent but incorrect ( van rei and zydney 2007 ) classifi as nanofiltr ( burnouf et al. 2005 ) . \\n 2.1 regener cellulos hollow fiber ( hf ) membran filter \\n common virus filtrat membran are made from poly(ethersulfon ) ( pes ) , poly(vinyliden fluorid ) ( pvdf ) , and regener cellulos ( burnouf and radosevich 2003 ; carter and lutz 2002 ; liu et al. 2010 ; van rei and zydney 2007 ) . among the latter , the commerci planova tm filter ( asahi kasei medic , tokyo , japan ) have been wide use to clear virus from biolog produc pharmaceut , in particular blood product . planova filter are compos of cuprammonium regener cellulos hf ( bemberg tm cupro fiber ) , prepar from cellulos cuprammonium spin solut via microphas separ under precis spin condit ( tsurumi et al. 1990b , c ) . the wall of each hf has a threedimension web structur of pore consist of larg , bulki void pore interconnect by fine capillari ( tsurumi et al. 1990a , b , c ) ( fig. 3 ) . dure filtrat , as the feed solut contain the product of interest is circul through the hf bore , virus accumul in the larg , bulki void pore of the fiber network while the product solut pass through the capillari pore . sinc the hf wall is sever ten of micromet thick ( fig. 4 ) , virus are captur gradual insid the porous structur that can be consid multi-lay ( 100 - 200 layer ) ( hongo-hirasaki et al. 2006 ) . henc , planova filter behav like '' membran depth filter '' ( walsh and denyer 2012 ) oper on the basi of size exclus . they offer a choic of 4 nomin mean pore size , name 15 nm ( 15n ) , 19 nm ( 20n ) , 35 nm ( 35n ) and 72 nm (75n)-the larg pore 75n model be essenti use as a prefilt to remov impur or aggreg prior to final virus filtration-and can be oper in normal ( dead-end/flow through ) or tangenti flow ( cross flow ) filtrat mode ( phillip et al. 2007 ) . planova filter have emerg to answer a publichealth problem of worldwid magnitud , i.e. , blood contamin by hiv ( hamamoto et al. 1989 ; manab et al. 1989 ) and hepat virus ( yuasa et al. 1991 ; sekiguchi et al. 1989 sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . tabl 1 give exampl of viral clearanc studi assess the capac of planova filter to remov virus from blood product . in these viral clearanc assay , product stream result from success , scaleddown purif step repres of the manufactur process of the product ( kundu and reindel 2007 ) , were artifici contamin ( '' spike '' ) with model virus of differ size ( tabl 2 ) ( at much higher concentr than what might be common found in the product intermedi ) befor be submit to filtrat . the virus remov effici of the filtrat step was express as lrv ( log reduct valu , i.e. , log ratio of the viral load in the spike product feed stream to that recov in the product filtrat ) , which impli that residu virus infect can never be reduc to zero but may be great reduc mathemat ( ich 1999 ) . minimum lrv valu were most frequent given . they were estim when no virus could be detect in filter sampl take into account the detect limit of the assay ( viral titer estim as 1 infecti unit per sampl volum ) . from the measur lrvs , the filtrat oper is usual classifi as effect ( lrv [ 4 ) , moder effect ( 1 \\\\

( 1981 ) and raphael et al. ( 1985 ) for indigen enterovirus in wastewat and rotavirus in sewage-pollut surfac water , respect . after determin the optim elut condit for 1 mds disk-adsorb norovirus follow filtrat of spike distil water sampl , lee et al. ( 2011 ) ( tabl 5 ) appli the optim procedur to the detect of norovirus in environment water . they combin adsorpt filtrat use 1 mds cartridg with organ floccul to enrich virus from largevolum surfac ( 200 l ) and ground ( 500 l ) water sampl . this integr two-step process led to high volum reduct factor , i.e. , 10,000 and 25,000 for surfac and ground water sampl , respect ( 200 - 5009 for filtrat , 509 for organ floccul ) , but it recoveri effici was not evalu by spike studi . in the same way , besid spike woo et al. ( 2012 ) . a ratio of the virus surviv factor in the treat filter to that in the untreat filter , where the virus surviv factor in a filter is the number of virus recov by elut from the filter divid by the number of virus remov by the filtrat process . b pf pp filter from commerci surgic mask ( dupont tm 01361n ) , ccf coars pore cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 54 , 22 lm pore size ) , fcf fine pore cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 50 , 2.7 lm pore size ) studi like those detail in tabl 5 , 1 mds filter cartridg have been wide appli to concentr enter virus in water sampl of differ origin ( tabl 6 ) , rang from large-volum sampl of weak contamin water intend for drink or drink water product ( borchardt et al. 2003 ( borchardt et al. , 2004 lee et al. 2014 ; sedmak et al. 2005 ; verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewat sampl with high viral content-to assess the virus remov effici of wastewat treatment plant ( kuo et al. 2010 ; simmon et al. 2011 ) . in these test of field water sampl for enter virus , 1 mds filtrat was main combin with second-stag concentr by organ floccul as detail by fout et al. ( 2001 ) in the usepa ( unit state environment protect agenc ) manual of method for virolog . the elut of filter-adsorb viral particl was most perform with an alkalin beef extract solut supplement or not with glycin ( buffer eb3 and eb1 in tabl 5 ) . the work by verheyen et al. ( 2009 ) is an except to these common procedur . to concentr virus in small-volum sampl from drink water sourc , these author use two filter cartridg in seri with no addit concentr step and an alkalin powder milk solut as elut buffer . they found that 20 % ( 3/15 ) and 13 % ( 32/247 ) of surfac and ground ( well ) water sourc , respect , were contamin with adenovirus , with veri few sampl posit to rotavirus ( 0/15 surfac water sampl , 6/247 well water sourc ) . despit the differ in virus concentr method , these result compar with those obtain by xagoraraki et al. ( 2007 ) and cheong et al. ( 2009 ) for adenovirus detect in surfac ( 14/58 sampl , 24 % ) and ground water ( 4/29 sampl , 14 % ) , respect . they also agre with data report by borchardt et al. ( 2003 ) and cheong et al. ( 2009 ) show the low contamin level of ground water by rotavirus . it is worth note here , howev , that the number of posit sampl report in these viral analys of water ( and the other quot in tabl 6 ) is depend on the sensit of the detect techniqu use to assess the presenc of virus , i.e. , nucleic acid-bas amplif method such as convent pcr , reverse-transcript pcr ( rt-pcr ) , nest pcr , real-tim pcr/rt-pcr or integr cell cultur pcr ( icc/pcr ) to determin virus infect ( fong and lipp 2005 ; hamza et al. 2011 , mattison and bidawid 2009 ; watzing et al. 2006 ) with differ detect threshold . \\n it emerg from this glanc at literatur that cellulose-bas electroposit filter are still common use for viral monitor of water . these filter are expens , howev , and face competit with cheaper product , in particular nanoalumina fiber filter and glass wool filter ( cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . the former , nanoceram tm filter manufactur by argonid corpor ( sanford , fla. , usa ) , are compos of nanos ( 2 nm diamet ) , alumina-bas { main boehmit , c-alo(oh ) } fibrill dispers in a microglass fiber matrix , result in an electroposit filter media with 2 - 3 lm averag pore size kaledin 2005 , 2006 ) . the latter consist of commerci sodocalc glass wool coat with miner oil ( type bourr 725 qn/tech loos wool , isov saint-gobain , courbevoi , franc ) , hand pack into column or filter holder in the laboratori ( vilagin\\u00e8 et al. 1993 ) . these glass wool filter harbor electroposit site while present hydrophob surfac characterist . effici enrich of ( seed or/ and ) indigen virus from various water sampl use nanoceram ( gibbon et al. 2010 ; ikner et al. 2011 ; pang et al. 2012 ) , and glass wool ( debooser et al. 2011 ; lambertini et al. 2008 ; wyn-jon et al. 2011 ) filter has been report in recent year ( see also cashdollar and wymer 2013 ; wong et al. 2012 ) . compar with 1 mds filter ( tabl 5 ) , nanoceram filter show similar , slight lower ( mcminn 2013 ) or higher ( karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentr effici . \\n commerci avail under differ pore size ( 0.025 - 8.0 lm ) , mix cellulos ester membran filter are negat charg over a wide rang of ph valu , their overal negat charg increas with ph ( kessick and wagner 1978 ) . micropor filter in the 0.1 - 0.45 lm pore size rang have been use for age in laboratori and industri for size-bas filtrat of bacteri particl and cell debri ( surfac filter ) . these and larger pore size filter have been shown to retain enterovirus , howev , despit the much smaller size of viral particl compar to the nomin mean diamet of filter pore ( cliver 1968 ) . the presenc of salt enhanc virus adsorpt to cellulos ester membran , this effect increas with the cation valenc ( i.e. , al 3 ? [ mg 2 ?

( 2002 ) appli ha filtrat , follow by acid rins of the filter , viral elut with naoh and secondari concentr of the eluat by cu , to concentr natur occur virus ( norovirus , enterovirus and hav-hepat a virus ) in seawat sampl . base on the volum reduct factor ( 2-l sample/2 ml final concentr , i.e. , 1000 ) and the recoveri yield of the two-step process ( tabl 7 ) , a virus concentr factor of 670 was reach . onli hav virus was not detect in ani sampl test . later on , katayama et al. ( 2008 ) follow the same protocol to concentr enter virus in the raw influent of a wastewat treatment plant . sampl of 100-ml volum were collect and submit to the two-step concentr process , yield a volum reduct factor of c. 140 . the four test kind of enter virus were detect in all 72 wastewat sampl but one lack norovirus gi ( nov gi ) . use peg precipit as the secondari concentr step , hamza et al. ( 2009 ) test river water sampl for contamin by enter virus and bacteriophag . a volum reduct factor of 5000 ( 10-l sample/2 ml final concentr ) and virus concentr factor rang between 1000 ( norovirus ) and 5000 ( adenovirus ) ( see tabl 7 for recoveri yield ) were obtain . all 41 analyz sampl were found posit for enter virus . human adenovirus and norovirus were detect in 97.5 and 32 % of the sampl , respect . haramoto et al. ( 2004 ) illustr the abil of al 3 ? -coat filter to concentr virus from large-volum freshwat sampl without salt addit by detect norovirus in tap water from tokyo univers . tap water sampl ( 303-l averag volum ) underw two success filtration/elut step use 293-mm and 47-mm diamet ha filter prior to concentr by cu ( final volum : 0.9 ml ) , which ensur a volum reduct factor higher than 300,000 . howev , the virus recoveri effici of the 3-step concentr process was not evalu . ten of the 98 test sampl were found posit for norovirus . these result compar to those report by lee et al. ( 2011 ) ( tabl 5 ) use 1 mds cartridg with organ floccul to enrich norovirus from larg surfac and ground water sampl . \\n despit these promis data , the two viradel method base on electroneg filter ( i.e. , addit of mgcl 2 to water sampl or filter coat with al 3 ? ion befor filtrat ) have been essenti implement for viral analysi of water contain high amount of indigen virus , requir limit sampl volum ( tabl 8 ) -electroposit filter cartridg be more adapt to virus concentr from larg volum of weak contamin water ( tabl 6 ) . besid the above-ment work by haramoto et al. ( 2004 ) , onli two studi among those detail in tabl 8 describ virus detect in environment water sampl with low viral content , name drink water sourc after chlorin or without treatment ( rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwat from artesian well ( chironna et al. 2012 ) . both studi use small-volum sampl and cu as secondari concentr step , yield a modest volum reduct factor of 1000 . veri few from 202 artesian well water sampl were found posit to the test enter virus : none for hav and enterovirus , 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus ( chironna et al. 2012 ) . a larg proport ( 50 % ) of sampl from drinkingwat suppli was posit to adenovirus , howev ( rigotto et al. 2010 ) . these data are compat with viral analys of groundwat and water intend for drink perform use 1 mds filtrat as the first virus concentr step ( tabl 6 ) . it should be note , howev , that the same remark appli to data collect in tabl 8 as to those in tabl 6 concern the number of virus-posit sampl , i.e. , their depend on the virus detect method . this can be illustr by the two follow exampl . use icc-pcr ( measur infecti virus ) , katayama et al. ( 2002 ) detect enterovirus in 4 of 6 seawat sampl from bath beach , but no sampl was found posit by direct rt-pcr . de paula et al.

tellier 2006 ; verreault et al. 2008 ) . even though virus inactiv rate in the atmospher are general higher than those of bacteri and fungal contamin , virus-contain aerosol can spread worldwid ( despr\\u00e9 et al. 2012 ) . the threat of viral outbreak and pandem such as those caus by sar coronavirus ( yu et al. 2004 ) and high pathogen strain of influenza a virus ( tellier 2006 ) , alli with the fear of bioterror use virus ( e.g. , smallpox and hemorrhag fever virus ) ( barra and greub 2014 ) as biolog weapon , has encourag the search for effici protect equip against aerosol virus-contain particl . \\n individu respiratori protect devic consist in respir , i.e. , air-filt face mask design to protect the wearer against inhal of a hazard atmospher ( here airborn infecti aerosols)-oppos to surgic mask design to protect the environ from contamin generat by the wearer 's exhal breath ( i.e. , prevent of surgic infect ) . current , most '' filter facepiec '' ( ffp ) respir have a multilay composit structur with a central filter layer display electret properti ( gralton and mclaw 2010 ) . these electret filter ( thakur et al. 2013 ) are produc by impart an electrostat charg to a nonwoven fibrous mat compos of synthet polym fiber such as poly(propylen ) ( pp ) ( main ) , poly(butylen terephthal ) , poly(tetrafluoroethylen ) and poly(carbon ) fiber . electrostat charg of the filter media is common obtain by corona discharg , triboelectrif and electrostat spin ( tsai et al. 2002 ) . electret filter collect particl through the combin action of mechan and electrostat forc ( podg\\u00f3rski 2010 ; wang 2001 ( cen 2000 ) should retain respect at least 95 and 94 % of influent particl ( nacl particl are use as nonbiolog surrog particl ) ( rengasami et al. 2009 ) . first worn by surgic team a hundr year ago to prevent bacteri contamin of patient 's open wound , earli surgic mask were construct from layer of cellulos materi , more particular cotton cellulos ( gauz ) ( haller and colwel 1918 ) and deriv ( arnold 1938 ) ( see also belkin 1997 ) . much more recent , face mask made from cotton fabric have been test as altern respiratori protect equip against pandem outbreak such as influenza ( dato et al. 2006 ; davi et al. 2013 ; rengasami et al. 2010 ) . like respir , current commerci avail surgic face mask includ sever layer of non-woven fabric with , frequent , a cellulos inner layer in contact with the wearer 's face to improv wearer 's comfort . howev , the filter layer , usual made of meltblown fiber ( ghosh 2014 ) , is devoid of electret properti . sinc particul filtrat is onli mechan , i.e. , less effici than that of respir , most surgic mask are not certifi for use as respiratori protect devic , standard test to evalu their filtrat efficaci be less stringent ( oberg and brosseau 2008 ) . \\n while a number of studi have confirm that surgic mask logic offer lower protect than respir against aerosol particl , the effect of both type of face mask at prevent viral respiratori infect , in particular influenza , is still a matter of controversi ( bin-reza et al. 2012 ; cowl et al. 2010 ; gralton and mclaw 2010 ) . the improp facial fit of respir coia et al. 2013 ; weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protect effici against infecti aerosol . it allow particul flow outsid the filtrat area of the mask , result in face-s leak , i.e. , the leakag of infecti particl around the edg of the mask ( grinshpun et al. 2009 ; lei et al. 2013 ) . mask seal leakag can be minim by appli exist guidelin for correct don and fit check of respir . moreov , human face and head form model have been propos as a tool for design respir with improv protect effici , simul interact between face and facemask and describ their fit ( golshahi et al. 2013 ; lei et al. 2012 ) . the accumul of viral particl at the surfac and within the filtrat media of respir , where they can remain viabl and infecti for extend period of time ( coulliett et al. 2013 ; sakaguchi et al. 2010 ) , is anoth signific problem with which respir wearer are confront in the prevent of viral transmiss and spread . incorrect mask handl by the wearer may lead to accident self-inocul , cross-contamin affect both other healthcar worker and patient , and contamin of fomit ( casanova et al. 2008 ) . furthermor , the risk of virus reaerosol from respir dure extend use , if limit , can not be rule out ( fisher et al. 2012 ) . recommend for respir dof do exist but have proven insuffici to prevent virus transfer from respir to healthcar employe ' hand and cloth ( casanova et al. 2008 ) . ad antivir properti to the filtrat process may contribut to limit the risk of viral transmiss by improp handl of use respir . a number of virucid facemask have been develop and patent over the past 15 year ( tiliket et al. 2011 ) , some of which are commerci avail . in the spectrashield tm plus respir mask design by nexera medic inc. ( fort lauderdal , fla. ) ( haa 2008 ) , for instanc , two layer of filter media are sandwich between ( inner and outer ) antimicrobi layer where a silver-copp zeolit ( carrier ) antimicrobi agent ( agion \\u00f2 antimicrobi , sciessent llc , wakefield , mass. ) is embed around the core of synthet fiber ( fosshield \\u00f2 , foss manufactur , hampton , nh ) . the biofriend tm biomask tm ffp respir , manufactur by fillig ltd.

( 2012 ) also use bacteri cellulos in a composit antimicrobi materi suitabl for respiratori protect mask . a nonwoven polym fabric rev environ sci biotechnol ( 2017 ) 16:455 - 489 479 was coat with a film of bacteri cellulos mix with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improv the film-form properti , mechan strength and air permeabl of the coating-and chitosan , a non-sulf polysaccharid produc commerci by deacetyl of chitin that display strong antibacteri potenc ( kong et al. 2010 ; rabea et al. 2003 ) and , to a lesser extent , antivir activ ( rabea et al. 2003 ; wang et al. 2012 ) . \\n in the antimicrobi air filtrat devic propos by bernard ( 2006 ) , cellulos derivatives-mor particular , cellulos acet phthalat ( cap ) , a common pharmaceut excipi for enter coat of tablet and capsul with antivir activ ( pirron et al. 2011 ) -were use as '' biocid prophylact compound '' to provid the classic filter media ( e.g. , a nonwoven pp web , electrostat charg or not ) with antimicrobi properti . cellulos deriv could be incorpor as fiber or particl ( micron fiber ) into the air filtrat devic either in a separ layer posit befor or after the filter media , or deposit onto the outer surfac of the filter media relat to the air flow direct . to illustr this invent , handsheet prepar from cap fiber intermix or not with cap particl were success test for virucid efficaci by exposur to an aerosol challeng of enterobacteria phage \\u00f8x174 . \\n by exploit the antimicrobi properti of dialdehyd polysaccharid such as starch and cellulos dialdehyd , baney et al. ( 2012 ) propos a new method for produc low-cost virucid filter suitabl for respiratori protect mask . the treatment of a standard cellulos filter paper ( whatman tm grade 50 filter paper ) with sodium period improv it antivir potenc due to oxid of some cellulos to dialdehyd cellulos insid the filter . challeng with aerosol of ms2 enterobacteria phage at high relat humid ( 90 % at 23 \\u00b0 c ) , the treat filter show higher filtrat effici than a control , untreat one , i.e. , better remov of viabl viral particl ( plaqu form unit ) join to a lower resist to air flow ( pressur drop)-du to increas pore size distribut ( woo et al. 2011 ) . higher inactiv of ms2 virus by the treat filter was also highlight , confirm an improv of it disinfect capabl ( woo et al. 2011 ) . howev , the filtrat and inactiv of airborn virus were less effect at lower moistur content of the filter , i.e. , at air humid level common encount in hospit set , in particular oper room ( balara et al. 2007 ) . furthermor , the inhal resist of the treat filter remain too high for applic to respiratori protect mask . the same pros and con appli to cellulos paper filter treat by immers into aqueous suspens of dialdehyd starch ( das ) ( woo et al. 2012 ) . while this treatment did not affect the remov effici of viabl ms2 virus from aerosol at high relat humid , virus surviv on the treat filter was reduc ( fig. 5 ) and the pressur drop decreas as das concentr increas . the drop in air flow resist remain insuffici for practic applic to respir . das treatment of a pp filter from a commerci ffp mask did not modifi the filtrat paramet ( virus remov effici and pressur drop ) of the filter but signific improv it biocid efficaci ( fig. 5 ) -an open of this treatment toward the develop of virucid facemask . anoth exampl of cellulos filter materi treat with cellulos deriv to yield antivir properti is given by tsurumi ( tsutsumi 2009 ) . this inventor devis a low-cost virucid mask filter made of a standard cellulos nonwoven fabric impregn with water extract of sulfon or amin styrenegraft cellulos . to reinforc the water retent properti of the filter media , a superabsorb resin such as poly(acryl acid ) was ad to the graft cellulos extract befor impregn of the fabric or incorpor into a separ layer cover the impregn fabric . low ( hydrogen ion from sulfon acid group ) or high ( hydroxyl ion generat by amin group ) ph condit insid the hydrat materi were claim to make it virucid against influenza a virus and calicivirus . the patent give no illustr of such antivir properti , howev . \\n studi publish by tiliket et al. ( 2011 ) and catel-ferreira et al. ( 2015 ) present anoth type of cellulosebas materi for airborn virus filtrat in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulos materi , i.e. , commerci kimwip \\u00f2 ( kw ) wipe ( kimberly-clark worldwid , inc. , dalla , tex . ) , was chemic modifi by coat with a synthet polym , i.e. , poly(ethylenimin ) ( pei ) ( tiliket et al. 2011 ) or graft of an antivir agent , i.e. , catechin ( catel-ferreira et al. 2015 ) . the filtrat effici of the modifi filter media was first test on aerosol t4d virus ( enterobacteria phage t4 , doermann 's strain t4d ) . then the treat filter was insert insid a commerci medic mask in place of it cellulos layer ( kolmi m24001 mask , kolmi-hopen , saint-barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'anjou , franc ) , and the reconstruct mask was challeng with td4 aerosol to evalu it virus remov effici . both treatment signific improv the virus captur factor ( ratio of upstream to downstream pfu content ) of kw cellulos wipe and of reconstruct commerci mask compar to origin mask and to mask reconstruct with untreat wipe . in these studi , the breathabl of reconstruct mask was not quantifi , nor was the virus surviv on the modifi filter media . howev , addit filtrat experi use aerosol of influenza a virus ( low pathogen h5n2 strain ) show that challeng viral particl accumul in pei function kw layer with no loss in number and infect ( tiliket et al. 2011 ) . thus these modifi mask show no virucid effect , the peimodifi layer behav like an electret media owe to the polycation charact of pei . on the other hand , sinc catechin and catechin-graft wipe show antivir activ against t4d virus in liquid media ( catel-ferreira et al. 2015 ) , it may be assum that part of virus accumul in excess in the treat wipe were inactiv by the polyphenol agent , i.e. , the reconstruct mask were actual virucid . \\n despit these few exampl , the use of cellulos media in filtrat devic aim at the captur of airborn viral particl remain now veri limit compar to filtrat of virus-contamin liquid sampl . while patent , sever cellulose-bas , virucid filter media design for insert in air filter face mask have not been commerci develop yet . \\n besid the wear of person respiratori protect equip , anoth aspect of the fight against airborn infect lie in the decontamin of indoor air in healthcar facil , and , more general , of air process through heat , ventil and air condit ( hvac ) system in the built environ . high effici particul air ( hepa ) filter are the primari technolog use for particul remov in these collect protect devices- with uv irradi , ozon or air ionize to yield indoor air decontamin ( bolashikov and melikov 2009 ; jacob et al. 2013 ) -and may be complement with a photytocatalyst such as tio 2 to improv the inactiv of accumul microorgan pigeot-remi et al. 2014 ) . sinc hepa filter are essenti made of glass fiber , they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retent properti will not be detail further . \\n most frequent associ with other virus reduct ( virus clearanc of biopharmaceut ) or concentr ( viral analysi of water ) step , size-exclus and/ or adsorpt ( charg mediat ) filtrat is an essenti tool to fight against viral contamin in aqueous media . owe to inher properti of cellulos , includ mechan strength and hydrophil ( that oppos protein adsorpt and biofoul ) , alli with widespread avail and biocompat , cellulose-bas materi are still wide present in viral filter . develop commerci over the past thirti year , sever cellulos filter media have been and continu to be use for both routin analys in laboratori and academ research studi aim at improv the filtrat perform , generat a wealth of data quantifi the effici of virus remov or recovery/concentr from biolog or water sampl , respect . \\n as concern biopharmaceut compound , these data aris from valid studi of the filtrat step perform by spike intermedi biolog solut ( most blood protein ) from multistag purif process with known titer of viral particl . regener cellulos hf planova filter n15-n35 , oper in the dead-end mode as a singl filter or two unit in seri , were shown to provid lrv valu rang between 4 and 7 , on the averag . increas test sinc their launch in 1989 , these cellulos filter compet with filter media made of synthet polym such as pvdf ( e.g. , viresolv \\u00f2 nfp-normal flow parvovirus-from emd millipor ; ultipor \\u00f2 vf grade dv20/dv50 from pall corpor , port washington , ny ) or pes ( e.g. , millipor viresolv \\u00f2 pro ; virosart \\u00f2 hs/hc/cpv from sartorius stedim biotech , aubagn , franc ) . the hydrophil natur of cellulos fiber is a definit advantag of planova filter over other for virus remov from protein solut , minim flux declin due to proteindomin filter plug ( cake format ) at constant pressur ( normal-flow ) filtrat ( rathor et al. 2014 ) . howev , they are usual oper at lower flow rate than filter made of synthet polym whose oper pressur is higher . hydrophil modifi pvdf membran filter design for virus remov from high-concentr protein solut at high flow rate are be develop by sever manufactur , includ asahi-kasei ( i.e. , planova tm bioex filter , launch in 2009 ) . \\n mani studi have also been report to assess the virus concentr effici of the viradel method use spike water sampl , prior to the detect of waterborn viral contamin in field water sampl . in this method , cellulos filter , whether posit or negat charg , are use for adsorpt captur of virus befor virus recoveri by elut with a lowvolum eluent . electroposit filter are more particular suitabl for virus captur in low-contamin , high-volum water sampl , e.g. , sampl of groundwat or sourc water for drink water product ( tabl 6 ) . though routin use , these filter are expens and face competit with nanoalumina fiber filter ( e.g. , the patent ahlstrom disruptor \\u00f2 electroadsorpt filter ) ( levi 2011 ) and glass wool filter , which are cheaper . on the other hand , effici virus adsorpt by electroneg filters-th standard , cost-effect mix cellulos ester membran microfilters-requir impract sampl pre-treat : their use is limit to viral analysi of highlycontamin water , for which small-volum sampl are suffici ( tabl 8) . \\n cellulos nanomateri may repres a promis perspect for cellulos materi in their applic to viral filtrat of liquid sampl , yield filtrat membran with higher mechan strength , water permeabl , surfac hydrophilicici and resist to biofoul ( carpent et al. 2015 ) . ma et al. ( 2011 ) have present a composit membran consist of an electrospun poly(acrylonitril ) nanofibr scaffold deposit on a non-woven poly(ethylen terephthal ) support . this two-lay membran was coat by a layer of cellulos nanofib and test for retent of ms-2 phage . at acid ph , phage particl were adsorb by the negat charg cellulos nanofib coat , yield a lrv valu [ 3.7 . later on , the same nanofibr composit membran was dope with cellulos nanofib function by graft with poly(vinylamin ) . ms-2 phage were adsorb at neutral ph onto posit charg amino-modifi nanofib , with a lrv valu of 4 . metrev et al.

METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.\",\n          \"250 words VIRAL ETIOLOGY AND OUTCOME OF SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS AMONG CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO THE PICU ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the viral etiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their clinical significance and prognosis among critically ill children.\\nPatients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded.\\nMain variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded.\\nResults: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV. Additionally, they were found to have a high Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, Predicted Death Rate and increased need for inotropic support at admission.\\nOur study showed critically ill children with LRTI without known risk factors to have high mortality when aged < 12 months, in the presence of multiple agents and when certain complications (ARDS, hepatitis) and X-ray findings were identified.\\nETIOLOG\\u00cdA V\\u00cdRICA Y DESENLACE DE INFECCIONES DE LAS V\\u00cdAS RESPIRATORIAS BAJAS ENTRE NI\\u00d1OS CR\\u00cdTICAMENTE ENFERMOS INGRESADOS EN UCIP\\nObjetivo: determinar la etiolog\\u00eda v\\u00edrica de las infecciones graves de las v\\u00edas respiratorias bajas (IGVRB), su importancia cl\\u00ednica y su pron\\u00f3stico en ni\\u00f1os cr\\u00edticamente enfermos.\\n\\u00c1mbito: unidad de cuidados intensivos pedi\\u00e1tricos (UCIP) del Hospital Universitario y de Investigaci\\u00f3n Goztepe, Universidad Medeniyet de Estambul (Turqu\\u00eda).\\nPacientes y participantes: se evalu\\u00f3 a un total de 115 pacientes ingresados en la UCIP para su posible inclusi\\u00f3n en el estudio.

Summary This study applied molecular-based method to investigate the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in 59 commercial pig farms in South Korea. The results of RT-PCR screening on a relatively large collection of faeces samples (n = 681) from January 2013 to March 2015 did not reveal the presence of PDCoV until the end of 2014. However, on March 2015, PDCoV-positive samples (SL2, SL5) were detected from SL swine farm in Gyeongbuk province. The phylogenetic trees based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related to the US PDCoV strains rather than those in China. Thought Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) grouped within US PDCoV cluster, the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes suggested that they are different.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 Background On December 31 st , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] .\\nOver the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3] . In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum readiness level [4] . As of April 24, France is the 6 th most severely affected country in the world (in terms of absolute numbers), with approximately 120,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5] . With about 6,000 deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].\\nThe first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 th [7] : in a series of 18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7] [8] [9] [10] .\\nCancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of severe outcome [8, 10] . These retrospective reports, of limited size and restricted to patients hospitalized in Chinese hospitals, may not be fully transposable to Western healthcare systems, as suggested by a preliminary report on New Yorkers admitted to ICU [11] .\\nOur study reports the COVID-19 features and outcomes experienced by inpatients and outpatients actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH) in the Paris area, France.\\nAll rights reserved.

Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19\\nwere hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external intensive care units.\\nSurgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (\\\"plan blanc\\\") required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by learned societies [12] , included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.\\nMedical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national guidelines for breast cancer patients [12] : ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to 75 mg/m 2 . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and everolimus.

Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were systematically reduced by one half and were discontinued whenever possible.\\nRadiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was hypofractionated whenever possible [12, 13] Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the French society of palliative care [14] .\\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms, but subsequently became available to all cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the viral RdRp gene. All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [16, 17] , the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, focal consolidation and linear consolidation. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans. Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [19]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (0: no involvement; 1: \\u226410% of lung volumes; 2: 11-25%; 3: \\u226526% involvement).

Starting from March 13th, 2020, all proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered, as the registry also allowed for clinical follow-up phone calls scheduled at days 8, 14 and 28. More frequent and/or longer follow-up was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also registered and prospectively followed. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 th , 2020. This report was written according to the STROBE checklist.\\nThree populations were considered: patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR (positive RNA test); patients who had a positive RNA test or for whom RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but suggestive radiologic findings (COVID-19 patients); patients with symptoms only. Main outcome of patients were defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor analysis was performed. As a sensitivity analysis, prognostic factor analysis of death only was performed. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.\\nFrom March 13 th , 2020 to April 25 th , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in Figure 1A . RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41 patients) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings (N=18 patients).

Figure 1B .\\nBreast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1 . Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients (17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension (36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).\\nAbout two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing anti-cancer treatments were representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).\\nClinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 2 . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the 59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm 3 ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. The most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities, observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. Figure 2 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease: no significant association was observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19 lung disease.\\nAll patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home.

The flow of COVID-19 patients during the the course disease is shown in Figure 3 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24 th , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nNoteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).\\nFurther details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Supplementary Table 1 .\\nAn exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19 population showed that only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). They remained as prognostic factors in the RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast cancer patients.\\nWhile 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [20]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients, as a whole, are not at high risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This apparent low incidence could possibly be attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been All rights reserved.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.\\nIn terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the subgroup with positive RNA tests. As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.\\nWhile lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus of attention to define patients at high risk.

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.\\nMucosal immunity plays an important role in prevention of invasion by pathogens, which could be induced via systemic or mucosal immunization.\\nHowever, both immunization protocols require an effective adjuvant to produce better immune responses.\\nMucosally delivered antigen in the absence of an adjuvant usually induces either a low or undetectable antigen-specific immune response or results in immune tolerance [7, 43] . At present, a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States or elsewhere. Examples include oral vaccines, which mostly comprise live attenuated antigens, against Poliovirus [29] , V. cholerae, Salmonella typhi [22] , and Rotavirus [14] , and a nasal vaccine against influenza virus [3] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective mucosal adjuvant is a high priority in the development of efficient mucosal vaccine.\\nA synthetic dsRNA, termed Poly(I:C), has been found be able to boost immune responses since the 1960s [10, 45] . Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).\\nPIKA is a particular derivative of Poly (I:C) comprising kanamycin and calcium chloride [25] specific IgG and IFN-\\u03b3 responses in mice [33] . Most recent studies also showed that PIKA can provide broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses and coadministration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic H5N1 subunit vaccine can lead to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvements of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice [18, 19] .\\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of this \\nProduct [24] was inactivated with formaldehyde. PIKA is an improved adjuvant formulation comprising a derivative of Poly(I:C), kanamycin and calcium chloride [23, 33] , which was manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices by NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore.\\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Hubei CDC and maintained in SPF environment throughout the experiment. The mice were immunized through either an intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV or 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV plus the indicated dose of PIKA. Mice immunized with PBS served as a negative control. The protocol for intranasal immunization required the mice to be anesthetized slightly with sodium pentobarbital and held inverted with nose up until droplets of vaccine that were applied to both external nares were completely inhaled [13] . All intranasally immunizing reagents were suspended with PBS. Individual mice received 10 \\u00b5L of inoculants for five times with a 30 min resting interval between inoculations (total volume, 50 \\u00b5L). For intraperitoneal immunization, vaccine compositions were adjusted with PBS to a consistent 200 \\u00b5L dose. Each mouse received three immunizations with a 2-week interval between each immunization.\\nAll samples were collected two weeks after the final immunization as previously described [9] . Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital plexus puncture. Saliva was obtained after intraperitoneal injection with 20\\u00b5g of carbamylcholine chloride. The vaginal tract of individual mice was washed with 30\\u00b5L PBS for three times, with a total volume of 90\\u00b5L. After removing feces, small intestine tissues were weighed, cut into small pieces, mixed with PBS (100 mg of small intestine in 200\\u00b5L of PBS), and rocked at 4\\u2103 for 5 h. For collection of lung washing fluid, the trachea was exposed surgically and the oral portion of trachea was clamped, a 1-mL syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle was inserted into the trachea, 200\\u00b5L of PBS was injected into the peripheral airways, and five cycles of aspiration and injection were repeated [36] . After centrifugation at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min, supernatants of all samples were collected and stored at -80\\u00b0C before antibody detection.\\nThe anti-SARS-CoV titer of each sample was determined by ELISA.

However, no specific sIgA titer could be detected in lung washing fluid (Fig.   3A ) although neutralizing activity could be detected in the lung (Fig. 2D) . One concern was how the the lung \\nWe also assayed the SARS-CoV specific IgG in the pooled mucosal samples as well as in the serum samples\\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 4 .

A parenterally administered viruslike particle even elicited 90% to 100% efficacy against infection and pre-invasive disease in previously uninfected individuals [15] .\\nFor determining correlation between neutralizing activity and antibody in serum and mucosal secretion, both IgG and IgA responses in serum and in mucosal secretion were tested. In our study, neutralizing activity was detected in lung samples from three groups of mice, in which only specific IgG but not IgA could be detected (Fig. 2-4) . Antibody analysis also indicated that it was specific IgG but not specific IgA response at mucosal sites that was correlated with neutralizing activity. It is very possible that mucosal IgG could also play an important role in contributing to the neutralizing activity at mucosal sites. It has been propose [41] , serum IgG induced in parenteral immunization could find its way to the mucosae to exert protective effects. The relatively high concentrations of IgG seen at particular mucosal sites may reflect a combination of constitutive transcellular or paracellular transport from the systemic compartment and specific transport mechanism [41] .\\nTherefore, detection of IgG response in mucosal sites is also useful for evaluation of mucosal immune response and related neutralizing activity.\\nBecause SARS-CoV infection occurs at mucosal surfaces, such as lung, digestive surfaces and even vaginal surface [20, 21, 26, 38, 40] , the induction of a neutralizing activity which could block virus attachment and infection is more important in SARS-CoV prevention. Our study showed that PIKA was effective at inducing neutralizing activity at mucosal sites when co-administered by intraperitoneal and intranasal immunization (Fig. 2) . Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA. This may partially result from certain loss of vaccine antigen, dilution by mucosal secretion, capture by mucus gels, attack by proteases and nucleases, or exclusion by epithelial cells when delivered through mucosal routes [30] .\\nHowever, it should be noted that intranasal immunization could induce much higher specific IgA responses than intraperitoneal immunization. Many studies already demonstrated that mucosal sIgA can inhibit viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular virus neutralization, and transepithelial transport of immune complexes [17, 28, 44] . Even rotavirus VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies that lack neutralizing activity can protect mice against infection by] rotavirus via an intracellular neutralization mechanism [5] . SARS-CoV-specific sIgA may also provide a similar kind of protection against SARS-CoV invasion at mucosal sites in the absence of classical neutralizing activities. If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.\\nThe adjuvanticity of PIKA may be mostly derived from its main component Poly(I:C). However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] . Takeshi [11] .\\nFor development and application of an adjuvant for human use, the priority is its safety. CT is the most potent known mucosal adjuvant, but it has adverse side effects, such as nasal discharge in humans. Here we determined the mucosal adjuvanticity of a new adjuvant, PIKA, which is a derivative of Poly(I:C).\\nPoly(I:C) itself is toxic to human and can be rapidly hydrolyzed despite its strong adjuvanticity [6] . PIKA is an improved adjuvant which was formulated as a [26] . All together, PIKA is well formulated as a stable and safe adjuvant.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of PIKA as an adjuvant can significantly raise the humoral immune response with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV in serum and mucosal sites. Therefore, PIKA is a good adjuvant candidate and can be also used as mucosal vaccine.\",\n          \"Abstract Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review. Virus capture/purification/concentration is critical in a number of biopharmaceutical and clinical applications. Validation of virus clearance is essential in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, in particular blood products (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; de Mendoza et al. 2012; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Shukla et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, large-scale, efficient purification schemes of viruses/ virus-like particles are required for the production of prophylactic vaccines and gene therapy vectors (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2006 Segura et al. , 2011 Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Virus inactivation technologies are commonly used to fulfil viral safety. They include physical (e.g., heat application, ultraviolet-and gamma irradiation) and chemical methods (e.g., solvent/detergent treatments) or their combination (e.g., exposure to photosensitizer plus UV light) (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Klein and Bryant 2009; Pelletier et al. 2006; Prowse 2013; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Solheim 2008) . Common methods for virus capture include filtration (Charcosset 2006; Grein et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) and chromatography in column or membrane configurations (Charcosset 2006; Gottschalk 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2013; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Segura et al. 2011 ). Viral filtration is usually the final purification step in the downstream processing of biopharmaceutical products, e.g., monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 1) , following one or more chromatography ''polishing'' steps that contribute to the overall virus removal efficiency of the process before concentration of the purified product. Filtration technologies are also extensively used for the capture and concentration of waterborne viral pathogens (Gibson 2014 ) from drinking, environmental, recreational or waste water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In addition, particulate air filters are used in personal respiratory protective equipment (i.e., face masks and respirators) Cohen and Birkner 2012; Rengasamy et al. 2004) to ensure shortrange protection of wearers against airborne pathogens-which include a number of viruses (Tang et al. 2006 )-and in air purifiers/cleaners to limit longrange aerosol transmission of infection in healthcare settings (Hyttinen et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2006) .\\nCellulosic membrane microfilters have been used routinely for ages in laboratories to perform the socalled ''sterile filtration'' (cold sterilization), i.e., the absolute removal of bacteria, yeasts and molds but not viruses (Walsh and Denyer 2012) from heat-sensitive liquid media. However, many virus filtration devices currently implemented are made from cellulose and its derivatives. Some eighty years ago, Gradocol, graded collodion (cellulose nitrate) membrane filters (Elford 1931; Bauer and Hughes 1934) have been extensively used in ultrafiltration to estimate the size of several medically important viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease (Galloway and Elford 1931) , vaccinia (Elford and Andrewes 1932) , herpes (Elford et al. 1933) , poliomyelitis (Elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza (Elford et al. 1936 ) (see also Ferry (1936) for an exhaustive review). Later on, commercial mixed cellulose ester filters with very low pore size, namely VF (virus fine), VM (virus medium) and VC (virus coarse) grade filters produced by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA-a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), have also been applied to virus ultrafiltration for grouping by size assessment (Hsiung 1965). As part of a series of papers surveying the antiviral applications of polysaccharide-based materials, the present review focuses on viral filtration using cellulosic filter media-most of which are commercially available products that have been extensively tested over the past twenty years for the removal/concentration/purification of viral particles from liquid samples, i.e., biopharmaceutical (namely blood products) and environmental (raw or treated) water samples. The application of cellulose-based filters in individual respiratory protective devices protecting the wearer against airborne viral pathogens is also detailed. Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for viral clearance or recovery/purification of viruses or virus-like particles will be presented elsewhere.\\nIn the processing of biological products, virus removal from the product stream while providing maximum product recovery is a critical task. It is more particularly difficult to eliminate small viral particles such as parvoviruses, which may contaminate blood products and mammalian cell cultures used in the production of recombinant proteins (Charcosset 2006) . Viral filters developed to answer this challenge are typically membrane (screen) filters ensuring a size-based rejection of viral particles via a sieving mechanism. Given the size of viruses, ranging roughly from 20 (Parvoviridae) to 400 nm (Poxviridae) (Segura et al. 2011) , viral filtration stands between microfiltration and ultrafiltration among pressure-driven filtration processes (Fig. 2) , though it is frequently but incorrectly (van Reis and Zydney 2007) classified as nanofiltration (Burnouf et al. 2005 ).\\n2.1 Regenerated cellulose hollow fiber (HF) membrane filters\\nCommon virus filtration membranes are made from poly(ethersulfone) (PES), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and regenerated cellulose (Burnouf and Radosevich 2003; Carter and Lutz 2002; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) . Among the latter, the commercial Planova TM filters (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) have been widely used to clear viruses from biologically produced pharmaceuticals, in particular blood products. Planova filters are composed of cuprammonium regenerated cellulose HF (Bemberg TM cupro fibers), prepared from cellulose cuprammonium spinning solution via microphase separation under precise spinning conditions (Tsurumi et al. 1990b, c) . The wall of each HF has a threedimensional web structure of pores consisting of large, bulky void pores interconnected by fine capillaries (Tsurumi et al. 1990a, b, c) (Fig. 3 ). During filtration, as the feed solution containing the product of interest is circulated through the HF bore, viruses accumulate in the large, bulky void pores of the fiber network while the product solution passes through the capillary pores. Since the HF wall is several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 4) , viruses are captured gradually inside the porous structure that can be considered multi-layered (100-200 layers) (Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006) . Hence, Planova filters behave like ''membrane depth filters'' (Walsh and Denyer 2012) operating on the basis of size exclusion. They offer a choice of 4 nominal mean pore sizes, namely 15 nm (15N), 19 nm (20N), 35 nm (35N) and 72 nm (75N)-the large pore 75N model being essentially used as a prefilter to remove impurities or aggregates prior to final virus filtration-and can be operated in normal (dead-end/flow through) or tangential flow (cross flow) filtration mode (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Planova filters have emerged to answer a publichealth problem of worldwide magnitude, i.e., blood contamination by HIV (Hamamoto et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1989 ) and hepatitis viruses (Yuasa et al. 1991; Sekiguchi et al. 1989 Sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . Table 1 gives examples of viral clearance studies assessing the capacity of Planova filters to remove viruses from blood products. In these viral clearance assays, product streams resulting from successive, scaleddown purification steps representative of the manufacturing process of the product (Kundu and Reindel 2007) , were artificially contaminated (''spiked'') with model viruses of different sizes (Table 2 ) (at much higher concentrations than what might be commonly found in the product intermediate) before being submitted to filtration. The virus removal efficiency of the filtration step was expressed as LRV (log reduction value, i.e., log ratio of the viral load in the spiked product feed stream to that recovered in the product filtrate), which implies that residual virus infectivity can never be reduced to zero but may be greatly reduced mathematically (ICH 1999) . Minimum LRV values were most frequently given. They were estimated when no viruses could be detected in filtered samples taking into account the detection limit of the assay (viral titer estimated as 1 infectious unit per sample volume). From the measured LRVs, the filtration operation is usually classified as effective (LRV [ 4), moderately effective (1 \\\\ LRV \\\\ 4) or Makino et al. (1994) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) ineffective (LRV \\\\ 1) (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Since filtration complements other viral clearance methods in the downstream processing of biotherapeutics (Brorson 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2007) , several studies quoted in Table 1 also report LRVs for common virus reduction steps such as inactivation by pasteurization (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007) or solvent/detergent treatment (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) , and chromatographic capture (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012) . Virus removal during the plasma fractionation process (Bryant and Klein 2007) leading from the crude plasma pool to the product (immunoglobulin here) stream has also been quantified (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) . Overall virus reduction factors obtained by addition of successive LRVs are given in these works, as illustrated by Table 3. In the virus spiking studies quoted in Table 1 , the actual viral filtration step was preceded by prefiltration to eliminate viral and/or protein aggregates that might be present in the spiked product solution. The presence of aggregated viruses may lead to overestimation of size exclusion effectiveness while contributing with protein aggregates to the fouling of viral filters, which reduces the membrane hydraulic permeability and may affect virus retention (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Pre-filtration was performed on the spikevirus stock suspension (Caballero et al. 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2010 ) on the product intermediate before virus inoculation (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012) , and/or on the virus Furuya et al. (2006) and Terpstra et al. (2006) CPV Canine parvovirus B19 V Gr\\u00f6ner ( and Terpstra et al. (2006 Terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spiked material (Chtourou et al. 2007; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006 Terpstra et al. , 2007 . For pre-filtration of the virus preparation, micro filters with a pore size adapted to the spike virus size, i.e., slightly lower than the virus size, were used to remove cell aggregates but not single viral particles-usual pore sizes ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 lm. Micro filters with 0.1-0.2 lm pore size (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007; , but also 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012 ) and 35N (Chtourou et al. 2007) . Planova viral filters were used to pre-filtrate the spiked product solution. In the latter work, the association in series of 35N and 15N filters led to efficient removal of small viruses such as PPV (Chtourou et al. 2007 ). This was not the case when 35N was used as the main viral filter after pre-filtration with 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) , which confirms previous date showing that the 35 nm pore size was too large to retain the smallest viral particles (Furuya et al. 2006; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006 ). Both 20N (Caballero et al. 2014; Furuya et al. 2006; Gr\\u00f6ner 2014) and 15N (Caballero et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2010; Terpstra et al. 2007; Planova filters and their combination (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012 ) showed effective virus removal over a wide range of viral particle sizes (Table 1) . As a general rule, the removal efficiency of the filters increased with the ratio of pore size to virus size, as illustrated by Gr\\u00f6ner (2014) and Terpstra et al. (2007) . This was also demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2010) by filtrating poliovirus type 1 (a picorvanirus) through Planova filters manufactured with different pore sizes, ranging between 15 (LRV = 6.9) and 35 nm (LRV = 0.2). The two-filter combinations were globally more efficient than single filters at removing small viruses from spiked protein intermediates, though two 15N filters connected in parallel for tangential filtration (Koenderman et al. 2012) yielded LRVs quite similar to those obtained using 15N alone (Terpstra et al. 2006 ). Care should be taken when comparing vertically the data collected in Table 1 , however. In addition to the sizes of viral particles and filter pores, the results of such virus-spiking studies are dependent on a number of process parameters such as the filtration operating conditions (filtration mode, transmembrane pressure, volume per filter area, tempera-ture\\u2026), the characteristics of the product feed stream (pH, conductivity, nature and concentration of the product\\u2026), or else the purity level and concentration of the virus spike. Moreover, several studies include pre-filtration (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) or viral inactivation (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) in the calculation of LRVs. This variability in test conditions for filtration-based virus removal makes difficult any comparison between LRVs collected from multiple sources as in Table 1 , even though some results (Caballero et al. 2014; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2010 ) contradict its influence on filtration performance, underlining the robustness of the filtration process. Also, some variations in virus removal capacity may occur between commercial filter modules owing to their manufacture from different batches of HF, as illustrated by Roberts et al. (2010) for 15N filters.\\nLike membrane microfiltration, depth filtration is widely used as a clarification step in biopharmaceutical purification to ensure removal of cell debris, large aggregates and contaminants from the product stream prior to purification processes such as column/membrane chromatography and viral filtration/inactivation steps (Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Vicente et al. Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Commercially available depth filters currently employed in bioprocessing are composed of cellulose fibers with a porous inorganic filter aid and a resin binder, generally cationic. For instance, the Zeta Plus TM filter media (3 M Purification Inc.-formerly Cuno, Meriden, CT, USA) is composed of a cellulose fiber depth matrix containing silica-based filter-aid material and positively charged by chemical bounding of a cationic charge modifier (Ostreicher 1991) .\\nVarying retention ratings are available (0.1-1.0 lm). The triple layered A1HC filter media from EMD Millipore include two depth filtration layers (cellulose ? diatomaceous earth) of different grades and a 0.1 lm-pore-size microporous membrane pre-filter made of mixed cellulose esters (van Reis and Zydney 2007). Hence, these cellulosic depth filters rely on both size exclusion and electrostatic adsorptive binding to effect separation (Liu et al. 2010) . In viral spiking studies (Barnette et al. 2012; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2008) , they were found to retain viral particles whose surface is negatively charged over a wide range of pH as their isoelectric points (pI) range most frequently between 3.5 and 7.0, with a mean value of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 (Michen and Graule 2010) .\\nViruses are recognized as a major cause of waterrelated disease (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) . Enteric viruses, more particularly, which are associated primarily with gastrointestinal illness (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) , are implied in most waterborne viral outbreaks (Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011 ). All types of water, including waters used for drinking (surface or ground supplies), recreational waters (fresh, marine, and swimming pool), agricultural waters for irrigation (rivers and groundwater) and waste waters (sewage or industrial effluents), have been shown to be potential vehicles for virus transmission (Bosch et al. 2008) .\\nContamination is most frequently of fecal origin (Bosch et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2012) . Although viral levels may be high at the contamination source, e.g., concentrations ranging between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particles per gram of feces are referred to in the literature (Michen and Graule 2010) , viral concentrations as low as 1-10 viral particles per liter may be found in environmental water (Julian and Schwab 2012) . Since enteric viruses display high infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Julian and Schwab 2012) , such titers may constitute a health risk and should be detected for reliable surveillance of viral pathogens in water. As a consequence, efficient concentration methods are needed to capture viruses in large-volume water samples and release the retained viral material in concentrated form. Most common methods are based on filtration processes (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In particular, virus adsorptionelution (viradel) filter methods have been widely implemented since the 1970s (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Briefly, in a viradel method, viruses from aqueous samples are reversibly adsorbed to microporous filters and then eluted from the filters in a small liquid volume (APHA, AWWA and WEF 1998). Adsorbent filters carry electrical charges and virus retention occurs via electrostatic interaction rather than by size exclusion. In other words, viradel filters act as depth filters rather than sieves. Contrary to viral filters that retain viruses by a sieving mechanism to achieve complete viral clearance, their pore size lies in the microporous range, which allows the high flow filtration necessary for virus capture in large water samples. Positively or negatively charged filters can be used in a viradel procedure, among which those made of cellulosic materials have been dominant over the last few decades.\\nSince their pI is below the pH of natural water (i.e., around neutrality) ( \\nHuang et al. (2000) Table 5 continued Filter type a Water nature No.\\n[0 tested earlier for concentration of viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 4 ). More recent studies made use of Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilters, however (Table 5 ). In these works, pure (e.g., distilled), tap, environmental or sewage water samples were seeded with varying enteric viruses that are common waterborne pathogens, i.e., members of the families Picornaviridae (polioviruses, coxsakieviruses, teschoviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses), Caliciviridae (noroviruses, caliciviruses) and Reoviridae (rotaviruses) (Fong and Lipp 2005) , or bacteriophages (enterobacteria phages) that are considered as alternative indicators of fecal contamination and as index organisms for the presence of enteric viruses in waters (Goodridge and Steiner 2012). Naturally contaminated waters containing sufficient levels of indigenous viruses, more particularly bacteriophages, were also used in addition to spiking studies sensu stricto (Table 4) . Following sample filtration, viral particles adsorbed to the filter were eluted in concentrated form using a variety of eluting solutions, the most common eluent consisting of a slightly alkaline (pH 9.0-9.5) protein solution (i.e., beef extract), frequently buffered with glycine-NaOH or another amino acid solution (sometimes supplemented with salt to aid disruption of electrostatic interactions between viruses and filters (Shields and Farrah 1983) , a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea) or a surfactant (e.g., Tween 80) to affect virus-filter hydrophobic interactions . Eluted viruses were quantified-using plaque titer assays, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recovery efficiency of the filtration step by comparing to input titers. This efficiency depends on a number of process parameters including the filter type and filtration conditions (e.g., filtration rate and pressure), the elution buffer composition and eluting conditions, the nature, input titer and titration method of the tested virus-in addition to the water matrix characteristics that may affect virus quantification and filter performance (Borchardt et al. 2013) . Hence, Tables 4 and 5 display a wide range of recovery yields. In practical tests aimed at the detection of naturallyoccurring viruses in field, large-volume water samples, the filtration (adsorption-elution) step is usually a primary concentration step which is followed by a secondary one to reach the virus detection threshold, e.g., organic flocculation or PEG precipitation (Lewis and Metcalf 1988) . The recovery yield of such two-step concentration processes was evaluated in several studies using seeded or naturally contaminated water samples (Tables 4, 5) . As a general rule, the viral loss due to secondary concentration was balanced by a huge increase in concentration factor allowing virus detection in water concentrates from large-volume samples, as reported by Chang et al. (1981) and Raphael et al. (1985) for indigenous enteroviruses in wastewater and rotaviruses in sewage-polluted surface water, respectively. After determining the optimal elution conditions for 1 MDS disk-adsorbed noroviruses following filtration of spiked distilled water samples, Lee et al. (2011) (Table 5 ) applied the optimized procedure to the detection of noroviruses in environmental water. They combined adsorptive filtration using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich viruses from largevolume surface (200 l) and ground (500 l) water samples. This integrated two-step process led to high volume reduction factors, i.e., 10,000 and 25,000 for surface and ground water samples, respectively (200-5009 for filtration, 509 for organic flocculation), but its recovery efficiency was not evaluated by spiking studies. In the same way, beside spiking Woo et al. (2012) . a Ratio of the virus survival factor in the treated filter to that in the untreated filter, where the virus survival factor in a filter is the number of viruses recovered by elution from the filter divided by the number of viruses removed by the filtration process. b PF PP filter from commercial surgical mask (DuPont TM 01361N), CCF coarse pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 54, 22 lm pore size), FCF fine pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50, 2.7 lm pore size) studies like those detailed in Table 5 , 1 MDS filter cartridges have been widely applied to concentrate enteric viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 6) , ranging from large-volume samples of weakly contaminated water intended for drinking or drinking water production (Borchardt et al. 2003 (Borchardt et al. , 2004 Lee et al. 2014; Sedmak et al. 2005; Verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewater samples with high viral content-to assess the virus removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Kuo et al. 2010; Simmons et al. 2011) . In these tests of field water samples for enteric viruses, 1 MDS filtration was mainly combined with second-stage concentration by organic flocculation as detailed by Fout et al. (2001) in the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) manual of methods for virology. The elution of filter-adsorbed viral particles was mostly performed with an alkaline beef extract solution supplemented or not with glycine (buffers EB3 and EB1 in Table 5 ). The work by Verheyen et al. (2009) is an exception to these common procedures. To concentrate viruses in small-volume samples from drinking water sources, these authors used two filter cartridges in series with no additional concentration step and an alkaline powdered milk solution as elution buffer. They found that 20% (3/15) and 13% (32/247) of surface and ground (well) water sources, respectively, were contaminated with adenoviruses, with very few samples positive to rotavirus (0/15 surface water samples, 6/247 well water sources). Despite the differences in virus concentration methods, these results compare with those obtained by Xagoraraki et al. (2007) and Cheong et al. (2009) for adenovirus detection in surface (14/58 samples, 24%) and ground water (4/29 samples, 14%), respectively. They also agree with data reported by Borchardt et al. (2003) and Cheong et al. (2009) showing the low contamination level of ground water by rotavirus. It is worth noting here, however, that the number of positive samples reported in these viral analyses of water (and the others quoted in Table 6 ) is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection techniques used to assess the presence of viruses, i.e., nucleic acid-based amplification methods such as conventional PCR, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR/RT-PCR or integrated cell culture PCR (ICC/PCR) to determine virus infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Hamza et al. 2011, Mattison and Bidawid 2009; Watzinger et al. 2006) with different detection thresholds.\\nIt emerges from this glance at literature that cellulose-based electropositive filters are still commonly used for viral monitoring of water. These filters are expensive, however, and face competition with cheaper products, in particular nanoalumina fiber filters and glass wool filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . The former, NanoCeram TM filters manufactured by Argonide Corporation (Sanford, Fla., USA), are composed of nanosized (2 nm diameter), alumina-based {mainly boehmite, c-AlO(OH)} fibrilles dispersed in a microglass fiber matrix, resulting in an electropositive filter media with 2-3 lm average pore size Kaledin 2005, 2006) . The latter consist of commercial sodocalcic glass wool coated with mineral oil (type Bourre 725 QN/TECH Loose Wool, Isover Saint-Gobain, Courbevois, France), hand packed into columns or filter holders in the laboratory (Vilagin\\u00e8s et al. 1993) . These glass wool filters harbor electropositive sites while presenting hydrophobic surface characteristics. Efficient enrichment of (seeded or/ and) indigenous viruses from various water samples using NanoCeram (Gibbons et al. 2010; Ikner et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2012) , and glass wool (Deboosere et al. 2011; Lambertini et al. 2008; Wyn-Jones et al. 2011 ) filters has been reported in recent years (see also Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . Compared with 1 MDS filters (Table 5) , NanoCeram filters showed similar , slightly lower (McMinn 2013) or higher (Karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentration efficiency.\\nCommercially available under different pore sizes (0.025-8.0 lm), mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are negatively charged over a wide range of pH values, their overall negative charge increasing with pH (Kessick and Wagner 1978) . Microporous filters in the 0.1-0.45 lm pore size range have been used for ages in laboratory and industry for size-based filtration of bacterial particles and cell debris (surface filters). These and larger pore size filters have been shown to retain enteroviruses, however, despite the much smaller size of viral particles compared to the nominal mean diameter of filter pores (Cliver 1968 ). The presence of salts enhanced virus adsorption to cellulose ester membranes, this effect increasing with the cation valence (i.e., Al 3? [ Mg 2? [ Na ? ) (Wallis et al. 1972) . Acidification of the viral suspension also improved virus adsorption efficiency, even in the absence of exogenously added salts (Sobsey et al. 1973 ). These early results were later confirmed by Lukasik et al. (2000) , who investigated the influence of mono-, di-, and trivalent salts (NaCl, MgCl 2 , and AlCl 3 ) on the adsorption of poliovirus and enterobacteria phages to the MF-Millipore TM membrane filter type HA (0.45 lm pore size) and the electropositive 3M TM Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilter at neutral or acidic pH. At pH 7, salts promoted virus adsorption to HA filter while affecting adsorption to 1 MDS filter. At pH 3.5, more than 95% of the viruses tested adsorbed to HA filter with or without salt added to the viral suspension-the salts interfering again with viral adsorption to 1MDS filter. Furthermore, the addition of urea or Tween 80 to the salt solution affected virus adsorption to both filters at pH 3.5 and HA filter at pH 7. In agreement with previous studies by the same group (Haramoto et al. 2004 (Haramoto et al. , 2005 Lukasik et al. (2000) explained these results by the antichaotropic effect of salts that increased hydrophobic interactions between filters and viruses and was impaired by the chaotropic agent or the detergent. At neutral pH, charge screeening by salt addition reduced electrostatic attractive and repulsive forces between viruses and 1 MDS or HA filter, respectively. Cation-mediated cross-complexation between negative groups on virus and filter surfaces (Kessick and Wagner 1978) and, more particularly, strengthened hydrophobic virusfilter interactions contributed to improving the adsorption efficiency of HA filter. At acidic pH, viruses displayed a positive surface charge and their electrostatic interactions with HA filter switched from repulsive to attractive-and inversely for electropositive 1 MDS filter. The presence of salt probably affected these interactions but was balanced by the promoting effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions.\\nHence, most tests reported so far for virus concentration from water samples using cellulose ester filters (essentially HA filters) have been performed after addition of multivalent cations (mainly Mg 2? ) to the water samples with or without pH adjustment to an acidic level. According to Katayama et al. (2002) , the virus-loaded filters were rinsed with an acidic solution to eliminate remaining cations before elution with NaOH or other alkaline buffers. Haramoto et al. (2004 Haramoto et al. ( , 2005 Haramoto et al. ( , 2007a proposed a variation in the method that consisted in pre-conditioning the filter with Al 3? ions. Aluminum chloride was passed through the filter, making an electropositive ion coating, which avoided cation addition to the water sample. The recovery efficiency of both protocols has been evaluated by seeding water samples with enteric viruses and bacteriophages and quantifying eluted viruses (Table 7) . Similarly to spiking studies (Tables 4, 5) and viral analyses of field water samples (Table 6 ) with electropositive filters, the HA-based filtration/elution process was frequently associated with a secondary concentration step to increase virus concentration factors. Here, centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) using commercial Millipore (Centriprep \\u00d2 , Centricon \\u00d2 or Amicon \\u00d2 ) concentrators was the elective concentration method. These CU units contain a low adsorptive regenerated cellulose membrane (Ultracel \\u00d2 ) whose nominal molecular-weight cutoff ranges between 3 and 100 kDa-a MWCO value of 50 kDa being most frequently selected for secondary concentration of eluted viruses. They are routinely used in laboratories to purify and concentrate biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids from small-volume biological samples (e.g., 2-15 ml for the Centriprep filter unit). Tested or not for virus recovery by spiking experiments, the combined concentration procedures have been extended to the detection of enteric viruses in field water samples including tap (Haramoto et al. 2004 ), sea (Katayama et al. 2002) , river (surface) (Fong et al. 2010; Hamza et al. 2009; Haramoto et al. 2005 ) and waste (Fong et al. 2010; Katayama et al. 2008 ) water (Table 8) . Samples with different volumes were collected according to the water source, i.e., sample volumes increased as the expected contamination level decreased. For instance, Katayama et al. (2002) applied HA filtration, followed by acid rinse of the filter, viral elution with NaOH and secondary concentration of the eluate by CU, to concentrate naturally occurring viruses (noroviruses, enteroviruses and HAV-hepatitis A virus) in seawater samples. Based on the volume reduction factor (2-l sample/2 ml final concentrate, i.e., 1000) and the recovery yield of the two-step process (Table 7) , a virus concentration factor of 670 was reached. Only HAV virus was not detected in any sample tested. Later on, Katayama et al. (2008) followed the same protocol to concentrate enteric viruses in the raw influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Samples of 100-ml volume were collected and submitted to the two-step concentration process, yielding a volume reduction factor of c. 140. The four tested kinds of enteric viruses were detected in all 72 wastewater samples but one lacking norovirus GI (NoV GI). Using PEG precipitation as the secondary concentration step, Hamza et al. (2009) tested river water samples for contamination by enteric viruses and bacteriophages. A volume reduction factor of 5000 (10-l sample/2 ml final concentrate) and virus concentration factors ranging between 1000 (norovirus) and 5000 (adenovirus) (see Table 7 for recovery yields) were obtained. All 41 analyzed samples were found positive for enteric viruses. Human adenovirus and norovirus were detected in 97.5 and 32% of the samples, respectively. Haramoto et al. (2004) illustrated the ability of Al 3? -coated filters to concentrate viruses from large-volume freshwater samples without salt addition by detecting noroviruses in tap water from Tokyo University. Tap water samples (303-l average volume) underwent two successive filtration/elution steps using 293-mm and 47-mm diameter HA filters prior to concentration by CU (final volume: 0.9 ml), which ensured a volume reduction factor higher than 300,000. However, the virus recovery efficiency of the 3-step concentration process was not evaluated. Ten of the 98 tested samples were found positive for noroviruses. These results compare to those reported by Lee et al. (2011) ( Table 5 ) using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich noroviruses from large surface and ground water samples.\\nDespite these promising data, the two viradel methods based on electronegative filters (i.e., addition of MgCl 2 to water samples or filter coating with Al 3? ions before filtration) have been essentially implemented for viral analysis of waters containing high amounts of indigenous viruses, requiring limited sample volumes (Table 8 )-electropositive filter cartridges being more adapted to virus concentration from large volumes of weakly contaminated water (Table 6 ). Beside the above-mentioned work by Haramoto et al. (2004) , only two studies among those detailed in Table 8 describe virus detection in environmental water samples with low viral content, namely drinking water sources after chlorination or without treatment (Rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwater from artesian wells (Chironna et al. 2012) . Both studies used small-volume samples and CU as secondary concentration step, yielding a modest volume reduction factor of 1000. Very few from 202 artesian well water samples were found positive to the tested enteric viruses: none for HAV and enterovirus, 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus (Chironna et al. 2012) . A large proportion (50%) of samples from drinkingwater supplies was positive to adenovirus, however (Rigotto et al. 2010) . These data are compatible with viral analyses of groundwater and water intended for drinking performed using 1 MDS filtration as the first virus concentration step (Table 6 ). It should be noted, however, that the same remark applies to data collected in Table 8 as to those in Table 6 concerning the numbers of virus-positive samples, i.e., their dependence on the virus detection method. This can be illustrated by the two following examples. Using ICC-PCR (measuring infectious viruses), Katayama et al. (2002) detected enteroviruses in 4 of 6 seawater samples from bathing beach, but no sample was found positive by direct RT-PCR. De Paula et al. (2007) found 48/52 river water samples positive for HAV by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, but only 12/52 by nested RT-PCR.\\nAs attested by the large body of literature data quoted above, virus adsorption-elution methods using electropositive or electronegative filters are routinely applied to the primary concentration of waterborne viruses, each type of filter possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. Ultrafiltration is considered another filtration-based option to concentrate viruses from water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). It has been indicated earlier that CU with microconcentrators based on cellulose ultrafiltration discs is commonly used as a secondary concentration step following the viradel process. Hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), however, is considered a potential technique for primary concentration of viruses from large-volume water samples, yielding better virus recoveries than the viradel method performed with either electropositive or electronegative filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Commercial HFUF devices operated in cross-flow mode have been applied to the simultaneous concentration of biological particles, including viruses, spiked in tap (Polaczyk et al. 2008) or reclaimed (Liu et al. 2012) water samples, to virus recovery from seeded tap (Rhodes et al. 2011 ) and estuarine (Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ) water samples, and also, more rarely, to virus recovery from field water samples (Grassi et al. 2010; Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ). Most of these devices are dialyzers that contain synthetic HF made from polysulfone. Following the early work by Belfort et al. (1976) showing that polysulfone HF membranes were superior to cellulose acetate ones for virus concentration, virus concentration experiments using HFUF dialyzers equipped with HF manufactured from cellulose are scarce. An example is given by Liu et al. (2012) . They showed that the Exeltra Plus 210 cellulose triacetate HF dialyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) and the Optiflux \\u00d2 F200NR polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Walthamm, MA, USA) provided similar recovery efficiencies for MS2 and UX174 bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from spiked 10-l and 100-l samples of reclaimed water.\\nAn array of viral infections can be transmitted by the airborne route, in particular via aerosols (droplet nuclei) Tang et al. 2006; Tellier 2006; Verreault et al. 2008 ). Even though virus inactivation rates in the atmosphere are generally higher than those of bacterial and fungal contaminants, virus-containing aerosols can spread worldwide (Despr\\u00e9s et al. 2012) . The threat of viral outbreaks and pandemics such as those caused by SARS coronavirus (Yu et al. 2004 ) and highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus (Tellier 2006) , allied with the fear of bioterrorism using viruses (e.g., smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses) (Barras and Greub 2014) as biological weapons, has encouraged the search for efficient protection equipment against aerosolized virus-containing particles.\\nIndividual respiratory protective devices consist in respirators, i.e., air-filtering face masks designed to protect the wearer against inhalation of a hazardous atmosphere (here airborne infectious aerosols)-opposing to surgical masks designed to protect the environment from contaminants generated by the wearer's exhaled breath (i.e., prevention of surgical infections) . Currently, most ''filtering facepiece'' (FFP) respirators have a multilayer composite structure with a central filtering layer displaying electret properties (Gralton and McLaws 2010) . These electret filters (Thakur et al. 2013) are produced by imparting an electrostatic charge to a nonwoven fibrous mat composed of synthetic polymer fibers such as poly(propylene) (PP) (mainly), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(carbonate) fibers. Electrostatic charging of the filter media is commonly obtained by corona discharge, triboelectrification and electrostatic spinning (Tsai et al. 2002) . Electret filters collect particles through the combined action of mechanical and electrostatic forces (Podg\\u00f3rski 2010; Wang 2001 (CEN 2000) should retain respectively at least 95 and 94% of influent particles (NaCl particles are used as nonbiological surrogate particles) (Rengasamy et al. 2009 ). First worn by surgical teams a hundred years ago to prevent bacterial contamination of patient's open wounds, early surgical masks were constructed from layers of cellulose materials, more particularly cotton cellulose (gauze) (Haller and Colwell 1918) and derivatives (Arnold 1938 ) (see also Belkin 1997) . Much more recently, face masks made from cotton fabrics have been tested as alternative respiratory protective equipment against pandemic outbreaks such as influenza (Dato et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2013; Rengasamy et al. 2010) . Like respirators, current commercially available surgical face masks include several layers of non-woven fabrics with, frequently, a cellulose inner layer in contact with the wearer's face to improve wearer's comfort. However, the filtering layer, usually made of meltblown fibers (Ghosh 2014) , is devoid of electret properties. Since particulate filtration is only mechanical, i.e., less efficient than that of respirators, most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices, standard tests to evaluate their filtration efficacy being less stringent (Oberg and Brosseau 2008) .\\nWhile a number of studies have confirmed that surgical masks logically offer lower protection than respirators against aerosol particles, the effectiveness of both types of face masks at preventing viral respiratory infection, in particular influenza, is still a matter of controversy (Bin-Reza et al. 2012; Cowling et al. 2010; Gralton and McLaws 2010) . The improper facial fit of respirators Coia et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protection efficiency against infectious aerosols. It allows particulate flows outside the filtration area of the mask, resulting in face-seal leaks, i.e., the leakage of infectious particles around the edges of the mask (Grinshpun et al. 2009; Lei et al. 2013) . Mask seal leakage can be minimized by applying existing guidelines for correct donning and fit checking of respirators . Moreover, human face and head form models have been proposed as a tool for designing respirators with improved protection efficiency, simulating interactions between faces and facemasks and describing their fit (Golshahi et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2012) . The accumulation of viral particles at the surface and within the filtration media of respirators, where they can remain viable and infectious for extended periods of time (Coulliette et al. 2013; Sakaguchi et al. 2010) , is another significant problem with which respirator wearers are confronted in the prevention of viral transmission and spread. Incorrect mask handling by the wearer may lead to accidental self-inoculation, cross-contaminations affecting both other healthcare workers and patients, and contamination of fomites (Casanova et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the risk of virus reaerosolization from respirators during extended use, if limited, cannot be ruled out (Fisher et al. 2012) . Recommendations for respirator doffing do exist but have proven insufficient to prevent virus transfer from respirator to healthcare employees' hands and clothing (Casanova et al. 2008) . Adding antiviral properties to the filtration process may contribute to limit the risk of viral transmission by improper handling of used respirators. A number of virucidal facemasks have been developed and patented over the past 15 years (Tiliket et al. 2011) , some of which are commercially available. In the SpectraShield TM Plus respirator masks designed by Nexera Medical Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) (Haas 2008), for instance, two layers of filter media are sandwiched between (inner and outer) antimicrobial layers where a silver-copper zeolite (carrier) antimicrobial agent (Agion \\u00d2 antimicrobial, Sciessent LLC, Wakefield, Mass.) is embedded around the core of synthetic fibers (Fosshield \\u00d2 , Foss Manufacturing, Hampton, NH). The Biofriend TM Biomask TM FFP respirator, manufactured by Filligent Ltd. (Hong Kong) and distributed by Medline Industries, Inc. (Mundelein, Ill.) , is another four-layered device in which the melt-blown PP filtration layer is inserted between an inner layer of spunbond PP and two antiviral layers, namely a cellulose/polyester layer containing copper and zinc ions and an outer layer of spunbond PP treated with a low pH (citric acidacidified) hydrophilic plastic coating (Davison 2012; Stewart et al. 2014) . The outer layer absorbs infectious aerosol droplets and viruses are denaturated by exposure to citric acid. In the second layer, inactivation of viruses with damaged structures is completed by the virucidal effect of divalent metal cations. Contributing to the overall antiviral efficiency of the structure, the cellulosic component of this layer is a sulphated or sulfonated rayon fabric (Stewart et al. 2012 (Stewart et al. , 2014 to which a variety of viral human pathogens bind via the cationic sites of viral envelopes/capsids.\\nBeside the commercial Biomask TM respirator, various composite structures designed for filtrationinactivation of airborne microbial contaminants, where cellulosic materials play an active antimicrobial role, have been patented in recent years Bernard 2006; Nakamura and Nakamura 2011; Tsutsumi 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhong 2011) . Several of them are based on bacterial cellulose layers/coatings provided with an antimicrobial component, i.e., silver (Zhong 2011) or zeolite-supported silver (Nakamura and Nakamura 2011) nanoparticles, and chitosan (Zhang et al. 2012) . The respiratory protective mask described by Zhong (2011) comprises a three-layer bacterial cellulose membrane whose middle layer contains silver nanoparticles. The antimicrobial facemask invented by Nakamura and Nakamura (2011) includes two base cloth elements both of which are made of a woven textile (gauze), a nonwoven cellulose fabric (e.g., rayon), or a porous sheet (e.g., a 0.3-0.5 mm sliced sheet of urethane sponge). The first base cloth is filled with bacterial cellulose nanofibers that retain silver zeolite and a humectant (e.g., trehalose or 1,3-butylene glycol) in their network structure. Additional antimicrobial properties are provided to the mask by impregnating the second base cloth with a carboxylic acid (e.g., citric acid). Zhang et al. (2012) also used bacterial cellulose in a composite antimicrobial material suitable for respiratory protective masks. A nonwoven polymer fabric Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) 16:455-489 479 was coated with a film of bacterial cellulose mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improve the film-forming properties, mechanical strength and air permeability of the coating-and chitosan, a non-sulfated polysaccharide produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin that displays strong antibacterial potency (Kong et al. 2010; Rabea et al. 2003 ) and, to a lesser extent, antiviral activity (Rabea et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2012 ).\\nIn the antimicrobial air filtration device proposed by Bernard (2006) , cellulose derivatives-more particularly, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common pharmaceutical excipient for enteric coating of tablets and capsules with antiviral activity (Pirrone et al. 2011 )-were used as ''biocidal prophylactic compounds'' to provide the classical filter media (e.g., a nonwoven PP web, electrostatically charged or not) with antimicrobial properties. Cellulose derivatives could be incorporated as fibers or particles (micronized fibers) into the air filtration device either in a separate layer positioned before or after the filter media, or deposited onto the outer surface of the filter media relative to the air flow direction. To illustrate this invention, handsheets prepared from CAP fibers intermixed or not with CAP particles were successfully tested for virucidal efficacy by exposure to an aerosol challenge of enterobacteria phage \\u00d8X174.\\nBy exploiting the antimicrobial properties of dialdehyde polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose dialdehydes, Baney et al. (2012) proposed a new method for producing low-cost virucidal filters suitable for respiratory protective masks. The treatment of a standard cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50 filter paper) with sodium periodate improved its antiviral potency due to oxidation of some cellulose to dialdehyde cellulose inside the filter. Challenged with aerosols of MS2 enterobacteria phage at high relative humidity (90% at 23\\u00b0C), the treated filter showed higher filtration efficiency than a control, untreated one, i.e., better removal of viable viral particles (Plaque Forming Units) joined to a lower resistance to air flow (pressure drop)-due to increased pore size distribution (Woo et al. 2011) . Higher inactivation of MS2 virus by the treated filter was also highlighted, confirming an improvement of its disinfection capability (Woo et al. 2011 ). However, the filtration and inactivation of airborne viruses were less effective at lower moisture content of the filter, i.e., at air humidity levels commonly encountered in hospital settings, in particular operating rooms (Balaras et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, the inhalation resistance of the treated filter remained too high for application to respiratory protective masks. The same pros and cons apply to cellulose paper filters treated by immersion into aqueous suspensions of dialdehyde starch (DAS) (Woo et al. 2012) . While this treatment did not affect the removal efficiency of viable MS2 viruses from aerosols at high relative humidity, virus survival on the treated filters was reduced (Fig. 5 ) and the pressure drop decreased as DAS concentration increased. The drop in air flow resistance remained insufficient for practical application to respirators. DAS treatment of a PP filter from a commercial FFP mask did not modify the filtration parameters (virus removal efficiency and pressure drop) of the filter but significantly improved its biocidal efficacy (Fig. 5 )-an opening of this treatment towards the development of virucidal facemasks. Another example of cellulose filter material treated with cellulose derivatives to yield antiviral properties is given by Tsurumi (Tsutsumi 2009 ). This inventor devised a low-cost virucidal mask filter made of a standard cellulose nonwoven fabric impregnated with water extracts of sulfonated or aminated styrenegraft cellulose. To reinforce the water retention properties of the filter media, a superabsorbent resin such as poly(acrylic acid) was added to the graft cellulose extract before impregnation of the fabric or incorporated into a separate layer covering the impregnated fabric. Low (hydrogen ions from sulfonic acid groups) or high (hydroxyl ions generated by aminated groups) pH conditions inside the hydrated material were claimed to make it virucidal against influenza A virus and caliciviruses. The patent gives no illustration of such antiviral properties, however.\\nStudies published by Tiliket et al. (2011) and Catel-Ferreira et al. (2015) present another type of cellulosebased material for airborne virus filtration in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulose material, i.e., commercial Kimwipes \\u00d2 (KW) wipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., Dallas, Tex.), was chemically modified by coating with a synthetic polymer, i.e., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Tiliket et al. 2011) or grafting of an antiviral agent, i.e., catechin (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) . The filtration efficiency of the modified filter media was first tested on aerosolized T4D viruses (Enterobacteria phage T4, Doermann's strain T4D). Then the treated filter was inserted inside a commercial medical mask in place of its cellulosic layer (Kolmi M24001 mask, Kolmi-Hopen, Saint-Barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'Anjou, France), and the reconstructed mask was challenged with TD4 aerosols to evaluate its virus removal efficiency. Both treatments significantly improved the virus capture factor (ratio of upstream to downstream PFU contents) of KW cellulose wipes and of reconstructed commercial masks compared to original masks and to masks reconstructed with untreated wipes. In these studies, the breathability of reconstructed masks was not quantified, nor was the virus survivability on the modified filter media. However, additional filtration experiments using aerosols of influenza A virus (low pathogenic H5N2 strain) showed that challenged viral particles accumulated in PEI functionalized KW layers with no loss in number and infectivity (Tiliket et al. 2011) . Thus these modified masks showed no virucidal effect, the PEImodified layers behaving like an electret media owing to the polycationic character of PEI. On the other hand, since catechin and catechin-grafted wipes showed antiviral activity against T4D viruses in liquid media (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) , it may be assumed that part of viruses accumulated in excess in the treated wipes were inactivated by the polyphenol agent, i.e., the reconstructed masks were actually virucidal.\\nDespite these few examples, the use of cellulosic media in filtration devices aimed at the capture of airborne viral particles remains now very limited compared to filtration of virus-contaminated liquid samples. While patented, several cellulose-based, virucidal filter media designed for insertion in air filtering face masks have not been commercially developed yet.\\nBesides the wearing of personal respiratory protective equipment, another aspect of the fight against airborne infections lies in the decontamination of indoor air in healthcare facilities, and, more generally, of air processed through heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the built environment. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are the primary technology used for particulate removal in these collective protection devices-allied with UV irradiation, ozonation or air ionization to yield indoor air decontamination (Bolashikov and Melikov 2009; Jacob et al. 2013 )-and may be complemented with a photytocatalyst such as TiO 2 to improve the inactivation of accumulated microorganisms Pigeot-Remy et al. 2014 ). Since HEPA filters are essentially made of glass fibers, they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retentive properties will not be detailed further.\\nMost frequently associated with other virus reduction (virus clearance of biopharmaceuticals) or concentration (viral analysis of water) steps, size-exclusion and/ or adsorptive (charge mediated) filtration is an essential tool to fight against viral contaminants in aqueous media. Owing to inherent properties of cellulose, including mechanical strength and hydrophilicity (that opposes protein adsorption and biofouling), allied with widespread availability and biocompatibility, cellulose-based materials are still widely present in viral filters. Developed commercially over the past thirty years, several cellulosic filter media have been and continue to be used for both routine analyses in laboratories and academic research studies aimed at improving the filtration performance, generating a wealth of data quantifying the efficiency of virus removal or recovery/concentration from biologic or water samples, respectively.\\nAs concerns biopharmaceutical compounds, these data arise from validation studies of the filtration step performed by spiking intermediate biologic solutions (mostly blood proteins) from multistage purification processes with known titers of viral particles. Regenerated cellulose HF Planova filters N15-N35, operated in the dead-end mode as a single filter or two units in series, were shown to provide LRV values ranging between 4 and 7, on the average. Increasingly tested since their launching in 1989, these cellulosic filters compete with filter media made of synthetic polymers such as PVDF (e.g., Viresolve \\u00d2 NFP-Normal Flow Parvovirus-from EMD Millipore; Ultipor \\u00d2 VF Grade DV20/DV50 from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) or PES (e.g., Millipore Viresolve \\u00d2 Pro; Virosart \\u00d2 HS/HC/CPV from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). The hydrophilic nature of cellulose fibers is a definite advantage of Planova filters over others for virus removal from protein solutions, minimizing flux decline due to proteindominated filter plugging (cake formation) at constant pressure (normal-flow) filtration (Rathore et al. 2014 ). However, they are usually operated at lower flow rate than filters made of synthetic polymers whose operating pressure is higher. Hydrophilic modified PVDF membrane filters designed for virus removal from high-concentration protein solutions at high flow rate are being developed by several manufacturers, including Asahi-Kasei (i.e., Planova TM BioEX filters, launched in 2009).\\nMany studies have also been reported to assess the virus concentration efficiency of the viradel method using spiked water samples, prior to the detection of waterborne viral contaminants in field water samples. In this method, cellulosic filters, whether positively or negatively charged, are used for adsorptive capture of viruses before virus recovery by elution with a lowvolume eluent. Electropositive filters are more particularly suitable for virus capture in low-contaminated, high-volume water samples, e.g., samples of groundwater or source water for drinking water production ( Table 6) . Though routinely used, these filters are expensive and face competition with nanoalumina fiber filters (e.g., the patented Ahlstrom Disruptor \\u00d2 electroadsorptive filter) (Levi 2011 ) and glass wool filters, which are cheaper. On the other hand, efficient virus adsorption by electronegative filters-the standard, cost-effective mixed cellulose ester membrane microfilters-requires impractical sample pre-treatment: their use is limited to viral analysis of highlycontaminated waters, for which small-volume samples are sufficient (Table 8) .\\nCellulose nanomaterials may represent a promising perspective for cellulosic materials in their application to viral filtration of liquid samples, yielding filtration membranes with higher mechanical strength, water permeability, surface hydrophilicicy and resistance to biofouling (Carpenter et al. 2015) . Ma et al. (2011) have presented a composite membrane consisting of an electrospun poly(acrylonitrile) nanofibrous scaffold deposited on a non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) support. This two-layered membrane was coated by a layer of cellulose nanofibers and tested for retention of MS-2 phages. At acidic pH, phage particles were adsorbed by the negatively charged cellulose nanofiber coating, yielding a LRV value [3.7. Later on, the same nanofibrous composite membrane was doped with cellulose nanofibers functionalized by grafting with poly(vinylamine) . MS-2 phages were adsorbed at neutral pH onto positively charged amino-modified nanofibers, with a LRV value of 4. Metreveli et al. (2014) and Asper et al. (2015) have presented a size-exclusionbased filter paper made of pure cellulose nanofibers for removal of swine influenza A and murine leukemia viruses, respectively. These non-woven materials could be tailored to ensure efficient virus retention (Gustafsson and Mihranyan 2016a). Self assembled into nanosheets to yield ''mille feuille'' structures, they showed efficient removal of parvoviruses (Gustafsson et al. 2016b) : maybe a new filtration media for viral clearance?\\nA number of air filtration devices designed for individual protection against airborne viruses also include cellulosic materials. While published data on the filtration performance of cellulosic media for removal of viruses from air are scarce, industrial research is more apparent, in particular in Asian countries (China, Japan) where airborne pollution is a matter of great concern-the main objective being to add virucidal properties to the filtration media so as to inactivate accumulated viral particles. Therefore, some innovative media have been patented over the past few years with, however, no commercial development to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1405,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Radoshevich, Lilliana.

The phylogenetic trees<br>based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid<br>protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stemmed_and_lemmatized_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3   b a c k g r o u n d   o n   d e c e m b   3 1   s t   ,   2 0 1 9   ,   t h e   w o r l d   h e a l t h   o r g a n   w a s   i n f o r m   a b o u t   c a s e   o f   p n e u m o n i a   o f   u n k n o w n   c a u s   i n   w u h a n   ,   c h i n a   [   1   ]   .   a   n o v e l   c o r o n a v i r u s   ,   n a m e   s e v e r   a c u t   r e s p i r a t o r i   s y n d r o m   c o r o n a v i r u s   2   (   s a r s -

METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.\",\n          \"250 words VIRAL ETIOLOGY AND OUTCOME OF SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS AMONG CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO THE PICU ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the viral etiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their clinical significance and prognosis among critically ill children.\\nPatients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded.\\nMain variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded.\\nResults: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV.

Summary This study applied molecular-based method to investigate the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in 59 commercial pig farms in South Korea. The results of RT-PCR screening on a relatively large collection of faeces samples (n = 681) from January 2013 to March 2015 did not reveal the presence of PDCoV until the end of 2014. However, on March 2015, PDCoV-positive samples (SL2, SL5) were detected from SL swine farm in Gyeongbuk province. The phylogenetic trees based on the complete spike-and nucleocapsid protein-coding genes showed that SL2 and SL5 closely related to the US PDCoV strains rather than those in China. Thought Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) grouped within US PDCoV cluster, the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes suggested that they are different.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"body_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1441,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 Background On December 31 st , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] .\\nOver the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3] . In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum readiness level [4] . As of April 24, France is the 6 th most severely affected country in the world (in terms of absolute numbers), with approximately 120,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5] . With about 6,000 deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].\\nThe first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 th [7] : in a series of 18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7] [8] [9] [10] .\\nCancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of severe outcome [8, 10] . These retrospective reports, of limited size and restricted to patients hospitalized in Chinese hospitals, may not be fully transposable to Western healthcare systems, as suggested by a preliminary report on New Yorkers admitted to ICU [11] .\\nOur study reports the COVID-19 features and outcomes experienced by inpatients and outpatients actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH) in the Paris area, France.\\nAll rights reserved.

Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19\\nwere hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external intensive care units.\\nSurgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (\\\"plan blanc\\\") required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by learned societies [12] , included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.\\nMedical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national guidelines for breast cancer patients [12] : ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to 75 mg/m 2 . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and everolimus.

Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were systematically reduced by one half and were discontinued whenever possible.\\nRadiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was hypofractionated whenever possible [12, 13] Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the French society of palliative care [14] .\\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms, but subsequently became available to all cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the viral RdRp gene. All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [16, 17] , the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, focal consolidation and linear consolidation. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans. Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [19]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (0: no involvement; 1: \\u226410% of lung volumes; 2: 11-25%; 3: \\u226526% involvement).

Starting from March 13th, 2020, all proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered, as the registry also allowed for clinical follow-up phone calls scheduled at days 8, 14 and 28. More frequent and/or longer follow-up was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also registered and prospectively followed. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 th , 2020. This report was written according to the STROBE checklist.\\nThree populations were considered: patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR (positive RNA test); patients who had a positive RNA test or for whom RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but suggestive radiologic findings (COVID-19 patients); patients with symptoms only. Main outcome of patients were defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor analysis was performed. As a sensitivity analysis, prognostic factor analysis of death only was performed. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.\\nFrom March 13 th , 2020 to April 25 th , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in Figure 1A . RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41 patients) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings (N=18 patients).

Figure 1B .\\nBreast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1 . Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients (17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension (36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).\\nAbout two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing anti-cancer treatments were representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).\\nClinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 2 . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the 59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm 3 ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. The most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities, observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. Figure 2 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease: no significant association was observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19 lung disease.\\nAll patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home.

The flow of COVID-19 patients during the the course disease is shown in Figure 3 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24 th , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nNoteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).\\nFurther details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Supplementary Table 1 .\\nAn exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19 population showed that only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). They remained as prognostic factors in the RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast cancer patients.\\nWhile 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [20]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients, as a whole, are not at high risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This apparent low incidence could possibly be attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been All rights reserved.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.\\nIn terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the subgroup with positive RNA tests. As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.\\nWhile lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus of attention to define patients at high risk.

The appropriate anti-SARS-CoV antibody response, especially at diverse mucosal surfaces, would play a crucial role in protection against mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. For example, the passive transfer of neutralizing serum antibody to naive mice prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge [35] . Prophylactic administration of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, preventing the development of SARS-CoV induced macroscopic lung pathology [39] . Besides, mucosal secretory IgA in the lower respiratory tract, immune protection in the digestive tract and other mucosal sites seems to be crucially important given the fact that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs by direct contact with droplets of the virus by the fecal or oral routes [37] . Taken together, these reports suggest that a wide range of humoral immunity in systemic and diverse mucosal surfaces may play an important role in vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV transmission.\\nMucosal immunity plays an important role in prevention of invasion by pathogens, which could be induced via systemic or mucosal immunization.\\nHowever, both immunization protocols require an effective adjuvant to produce better immune responses.\\nMucosally delivered antigen in the absence of an adjuvant usually induces either a low or undetectable antigen-specific immune response or results in immune tolerance [7, 43] . At present, a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States or elsewhere. Examples include oral vaccines, which mostly comprise live attenuated antigens, against Poliovirus [29] , V. cholerae, Salmonella typhi [22] , and Rotavirus [14] , and a nasal vaccine against influenza virus [3] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that an effective mucosal adjuvant is a high priority in the development of efficient mucosal vaccine.\\nA synthetic dsRNA, termed Poly(I:C), has been found be able to boost immune responses since the 1960s [10, 45] . Recently, Poly(I:C) was discovered to function as an adjuvant through its interaction with TLR3, which in turn activates the NF-\\u03baB pathway, resulting in stable maturation of DCs, activation of NK cells and longer-time survival of activated CD4 + T cells in vitro [42] . Ichinohe et al. [11] reported that intranasal vaccination of hemaglutinin (HA) adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) can induce protection against influenza viral infection in mice. Brian R. Sloat also showed that nasal immunization with anthrax PA plus Poly(I:C) can enhance the production of mucosal and systemic immunities [34] . Therefore, Poly(I:C) represents another potential adjuvant. However, Poly(I:C) itself is unsuitable as a potential adjuvant because it is toxic and can be rapidly hydrolyzed in humans when used alone [6] . Several Poly(I:C) derivatives have been suggested, such as Poly(ICLC), which is Poly (I:C) containing Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose [2] , to minimize observed deficiencies of Poly (I:C).\\nPIKA is a particular derivative of Poly (I:C) comprising kanamycin and calcium chloride [25] specific IgG and IFN-\\u03b3 responses in mice [33] . Most recent studies also showed that PIKA can provide broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses and coadministration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic H5N1 subunit vaccine can lead to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvements of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice [18, 19] .\\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of this \\nProduct [24] was inactivated with formaldehyde. PIKA is an improved adjuvant formulation comprising a derivative of Poly(I:C), kanamycin and calcium chloride [23, 33] , which was manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices by NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore.\\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Hubei CDC and maintained in SPF environment throughout the experiment. The mice were immunized through either an intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV or 10 \\u00b5g of inactivated SARS-CoV plus the indicated dose of PIKA. Mice immunized with PBS served as a negative control. The protocol for intranasal immunization required the mice to be anesthetized slightly with sodium pentobarbital and held inverted with nose up until droplets of vaccine that were applied to both external nares were completely inhaled [13] . All intranasally immunizing reagents were suspended with PBS. Individual mice received 10 \\u00b5L of inoculants for five times with a 30 min resting interval between inoculations (total volume, 50 \\u00b5L). For intraperitoneal immunization, vaccine compositions were adjusted with PBS to a consistent 200 \\u00b5L dose. Each mouse received three immunizations with a 2-week interval between each immunization.\\nAll samples were collected two weeks after the final immunization as previously described [9] . Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital plexus puncture. Saliva was obtained after intraperitoneal injection with 20\\u00b5g of carbamylcholine chloride. The vaginal tract of individual mice was washed with 30\\u00b5L PBS for three times, with a total volume of 90\\u00b5L. After removing feces, small intestine tissues were weighed, cut into small pieces, mixed with PBS (100 mg of small intestine in 200\\u00b5L of PBS), and rocked at 4\\u2103 for 5 h. For collection of lung washing fluid, the trachea was exposed surgically and the oral portion of trachea was clamped, a 1-mL syringe equipped with a 22-gauge needle was inserted into the trachea, 200\\u00b5L of PBS was injected into the peripheral airways, and five cycles of aspiration and injection were repeated [36] . After centrifugation at 7 000 \\u00d7g for 15 min, supernatants of all samples were collected and stored at -80\\u00b0C before antibody detection.\\nThe anti-SARS-CoV titer of each sample was determined by ELISA.

The ability to induce a secretory (Fig. 3A) , whereas a 500-fold (p=0.002) and 10-fold (p=0.037) increase of sIgA titer could be induced when PIKA was coadministrated with antigen by intranasal and interperitoneal respectively. However, no specific sIgA titer could be detected in lung washing fluid (Fig.   3A ) although neutralizing activity could be detected in the lung (Fig. 2D) . One concern was how the the lung \\nWe also assayed the SARS-CoV specific IgG in the pooled mucosal samples as well as in the serum samples\\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 4 .

A parenterally administered viruslike particle even elicited 90% to 100% efficacy against infection and pre-invasive disease in previously uninfected individuals [15] .\\nFor determining correlation between neutralizing activity and antibody in serum and mucosal secretion, both IgG and IgA responses in serum and in mucosal secretion were tested. In our study, neutralizing activity was detected in lung samples from three groups of mice, in which only specific IgG but not IgA could be detected (Fig. 2-4) . Antibody analysis also indicated that it was specific IgG but not specific IgA response at mucosal sites that was correlated with neutralizing activity. It is very possible that mucosal IgG could also play an important role in contributing to the neutralizing activity at mucosal sites. It has been propose [41] , serum IgG induced in parenteral immunization could find its way to the mucosae to exert protective effects. The relatively high concentrations of IgG seen at particular mucosal sites may reflect a combination of constitutive transcellular or paracellular transport from the systemic compartment and specific transport mechanism [41] .\\nTherefore, detection of IgG response in mucosal sites is also useful for evaluation of mucosal immune response and related neutralizing activity.\\nBecause SARS-CoV infection occurs at mucosal surfaces, such as lung, digestive surfaces and even vaginal surface [20, 21, 26, 38, 40] , the induction of a neutralizing activity which could block virus attachment and infection is more important in SARS-CoV prevention. Our study showed that PIKA was effective at inducing neutralizing activity at mucosal sites when co-administered by intraperitoneal and intranasal immunization (Fig. 2) . Intranasal immunization appeared less effective than intraperitoneal immunization at eliciting neutralizing activity, even when adjuvanted with PIKA. This may partially result from certain loss of vaccine antigen, dilution by mucosal secretion, capture by mucus gels, attack by proteases and nucleases, or exclusion by epithelial cells when delivered through mucosal routes [30] .\\nHowever, it should be noted that intranasal immunization could induce much higher specific IgA responses than intraperitoneal immunization. Many studies already demonstrated that mucosal sIgA can inhibit viral infection via immune exclusion, intracellular virus neutralization, and transepithelial transport of immune complexes [17, 28, 44] . Even rotavirus VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies that lack neutralizing activity can protect mice against infection by] rotavirus via an intracellular neutralization mechanism [5] . SARS-CoV-specific sIgA may also provide a similar kind of protection against SARS-CoV invasion at mucosal sites in the absence of classical neutralizing activities. If this is true, the in vitro neutralizing activity may only reflect partial correlation with the protection effect of immune response.\\nThe adjuvanticity of PIKA may be mostly derived from its main component Poly(I:C). However, the adjuvant mechanism of Poly(I:C) is not clearly understood yet although it is believed to be related with to dsRNA structure and TLR3 mediated immune response. In-vivo, the presence of viral dsRNA can trigger cellular immune responses to viral infection through the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes including PKR, and the IFN-inducible 2'-5'-adenylate synthase/Rnase L system [12, 16] . In addition, mammalian TLR3's can recognize viral dsRNA, leading to the activation of NF-\\u03baB and the production of type 1 interferons which can serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems [1] . Takeshi [11] .\\nFor development and application of an adjuvant for human use, the priority is its safety. CT is the most potent known mucosal adjuvant, but it has adverse side effects, such as nasal discharge in humans. Here we determined the mucosal adjuvanticity of a new adjuvant, PIKA, which is a derivative of Poly(I:C).\\nPoly(I:C) itself is toxic to human and can be rapidly hydrolyzed despite its strong adjuvanticity [6] . PIKA is an improved adjuvant which was formulated as a [26] . All together, PIKA is well formulated as a stable and safe adjuvant.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that both intraperitoneal and intranasal administration of PIKA as an adjuvant can significantly raise the humoral immune response with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV in serum and mucosal sites. Therefore, PIKA is a good adjuvant candidate and can be also used as mucosal vaccine.\",\n          \"Abstract Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulosebased filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review. Virus capture/purification/concentration is critical in a number of biopharmaceutical and clinical applications. Validation of virus clearance is essential in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, in particular blood products (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; de Mendoza et al. 2012; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Shukla et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, large-scale, efficient purification schemes of viruses/ virus-like particles are required for the production of prophylactic vaccines and gene therapy vectors (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2006 Segura et al. , 2011 Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Virus inactivation technologies are commonly used to fulfil viral safety. They include physical (e.g., heat application, ultraviolet-and gamma irradiation) and chemical methods (e.g., solvent/detergent treatments) or their combination (e.g., exposure to photosensitizer plus UV light) (Bryant and Klein 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Klein and Bryant 2009; Pelletier et al. 2006; Prowse 2013; Radosevich and Burnouf 2010; Solheim 2008) . Common methods for virus capture include filtration (Charcosset 2006; Grein et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) and chromatography in column or membrane configurations (Charcosset 2006; Gottschalk 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2013; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Segura et al. 2011 ). Viral filtration is usually the final purification step in the downstream processing of biopharmaceutical products, e.g., monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 1) , following one or more chromatography ''polishing'' steps that contribute to the overall virus removal efficiency of the process before concentration of the purified product. Filtration technologies are also extensively used for the capture and concentration of waterborne viral pathogens (Gibson 2014 ) from drinking, environmental, recreational or waste water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In addition, particulate air filters are used in personal respiratory protective equipment (i.e., face masks and respirators) Cohen and Birkner 2012; Rengasamy et al. 2004) to ensure shortrange protection of wearers against airborne pathogens-which include a number of viruses (Tang et al. 2006 )-and in air purifiers/cleaners to limit longrange aerosol transmission of infection in healthcare settings (Hyttinen et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2006) .\\nCellulosic membrane microfilters have been used routinely for ages in laboratories to perform the socalled ''sterile filtration'' (cold sterilization), i.e., the absolute removal of bacteria, yeasts and molds but not viruses (Walsh and Denyer 2012) from heat-sensitive liquid media. However, many virus filtration devices currently implemented are made from cellulose and its derivatives. Some eighty years ago, Gradocol, graded collodion (cellulose nitrate) membrane filters (Elford 1931; Bauer and Hughes 1934) have been extensively used in ultrafiltration to estimate the size of several medically important viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease (Galloway and Elford 1931) , vaccinia (Elford and Andrewes 1932) , herpes (Elford et al. 1933) , poliomyelitis (Elford et al. 1935 ) and influenza (Elford et al. 1936 ) (see also Ferry (1936) for an exhaustive review). Later on, commercial mixed cellulose ester filters with very low pore size, namely VF (virus fine), VM (virus medium) and VC (virus coarse) grade filters produced by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA-a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), have also been applied to virus ultrafiltration for grouping by size assessment (Hsiung 1965). As part of a series of papers surveying the antiviral applications of polysaccharide-based materials, the present review focuses on viral filtration using cellulosic filter media-most of which are commercially available products that have been extensively tested over the past twenty years for the removal/concentration/purification of viral particles from liquid samples, i.e., biopharmaceutical (namely blood products) and environmental (raw or treated) water samples. The application of cellulose-based filters in individual respiratory protective devices protecting the wearer against airborne viral pathogens is also detailed. Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for viral clearance or recovery/purification of viruses or virus-like particles will be presented elsewhere.\\nIn the processing of biological products, virus removal from the product stream while providing maximum product recovery is a critical task. It is more particularly difficult to eliminate small viral particles such as parvoviruses, which may contaminate blood products and mammalian cell cultures used in the production of recombinant proteins (Charcosset 2006) . Viral filters developed to answer this challenge are typically membrane (screen) filters ensuring a size-based rejection of viral particles via a sieving mechanism. Given the size of viruses, ranging roughly from 20 (Parvoviridae) to 400 nm (Poxviridae) (Segura et al. 2011) , viral filtration stands between microfiltration and ultrafiltration among pressure-driven filtration processes (Fig. 2) , though it is frequently but incorrectly (van Reis and Zydney 2007) classified as nanofiltration (Burnouf et al. 2005 ).\\n2.1 Regenerated cellulose hollow fiber (HF) membrane filters\\nCommon virus filtration membranes are made from poly(ethersulfone) (PES), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and regenerated cellulose (Burnouf and Radosevich 2003; Carter and Lutz 2002; Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007) . Among the latter, the commercial Planova TM filters (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) have been widely used to clear viruses from biologically produced pharmaceuticals, in particular blood products. Planova filters are composed of cuprammonium regenerated cellulose HF (Bemberg TM cupro fibers), prepared from cellulose cuprammonium spinning solution via microphase separation under precise spinning conditions (Tsurumi et al. 1990b, c) . The wall of each HF has a threedimensional web structure of pores consisting of large, bulky void pores interconnected by fine capillaries (Tsurumi et al. 1990a, b, c) (Fig. 3 ). During filtration, as the feed solution containing the product of interest is circulated through the HF bore, viruses accumulate in the large, bulky void pores of the fiber network while the product solution passes through the capillary pores. Since the HF wall is several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 4) , viruses are captured gradually inside the porous structure that can be considered multi-layered (100-200 layers) (Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006) . Hence, Planova filters behave like ''membrane depth filters'' (Walsh and Denyer 2012) operating on the basis of size exclusion. They offer a choice of 4 nominal mean pore sizes, namely 15 nm (15N), 19 nm (20N), 35 nm (35N) and 72 nm (75N)-the large pore 75N model being essentially used as a prefilter to remove impurities or aggregates prior to final virus filtration-and can be operated in normal (dead-end/flow through) or tangential flow (cross flow) filtration mode (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Planova filters have emerged to answer a publichealth problem of worldwide magnitude, i.e., blood contamination by HIV (Hamamoto et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1989 ) and hepatitis viruses (Yuasa et al. 1991; Sekiguchi et al. 1989 Sekiguchi et al. , 1990 . Table 1 gives examples of viral clearance studies assessing the capacity of Planova filters to remove viruses from blood products. In these viral clearance assays, product streams resulting from successive, scaleddown purification steps representative of the manufacturing process of the product (Kundu and Reindel 2007) , were artificially contaminated (''spiked'') with model viruses of different sizes (Table 2 ) (at much higher concentrations than what might be commonly found in the product intermediate) before being submitted to filtration. The virus removal efficiency of the filtration step was expressed as LRV (log reduction value, i.e., log ratio of the viral load in the spiked product feed stream to that recovered in the product filtrate), which implies that residual virus infectivity can never be reduced to zero but may be greatly reduced mathematically (ICH 1999) . Minimum LRV values were most frequently given. They were estimated when no viruses could be detected in filtered samples taking into account the detection limit of the assay (viral titer estimated as 1 infectious unit per sample volume). From the measured LRVs, the filtration operation is usually classified as effective (LRV [ 4), moderately effective (1 \\\\ LRV \\\\ 4) or Makino et al. (1994) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) ineffective (LRV \\\\ 1) (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Since filtration complements other viral clearance methods in the downstream processing of biotherapeutics (Brorson 2007; Klamroth et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2007) , several studies quoted in Table 1 also report LRVs for common virus reduction steps such as inactivation by pasteurization (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007) or solvent/detergent treatment (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) , and chromatographic capture (Gr\\u00f6ner 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012) . Virus removal during the plasma fractionation process (Bryant and Klein 2007) leading from the crude plasma pool to the product (immunoglobulin here) stream has also been quantified (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) . Overall virus reduction factors obtained by addition of successive LRVs are given in these works, as illustrated by Table 3. In the virus spiking studies quoted in Table 1 , the actual viral filtration step was preceded by prefiltration to eliminate viral and/or protein aggregates that might be present in the spiked product solution. The presence of aggregated viruses may lead to overestimation of size exclusion effectiveness while contributing with protein aggregates to the fouling of viral filters, which reduces the membrane hydraulic permeability and may affect virus retention (Phillips et al. 2007 ). Pre-filtration was performed on the spikevirus stock suspension (Caballero et al. 2014; Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2010 ) on the product intermediate before virus inoculation (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012) , and/or on the virus Furuya et al. (2006) and Terpstra et al. (2006) CPV Canine parvovirus B19 V Gr\\u00f6ner ( and Terpstra et al. (2006 Terpstra et al. ( , 2007 spiked material (Chtourou et al. 2007; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006 Terpstra et al. , 2007 . For pre-filtration of the virus preparation, micro filters with a pore size adapted to the spike virus size, i.e., slightly lower than the virus size, were used to remove cell aggregates but not single viral particles-usual pore sizes ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 lm. Micro filters with 0.1-0.2 lm pore size (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2007; , but also 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012 ) and 35N (Chtourou et al. 2007) . Planova viral filters were used to pre-filtrate the spiked product solution. In the latter work, the association in series of 35N and 15N filters led to efficient removal of small viruses such as PPV (Chtourou et al. 2007 ). This was not the case when 35N was used as the main viral filter after pre-filtration with 75N (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) , which confirms previous date showing that the 35 nm pore size was too large to retain the smallest viral particles (Furuya et al. 2006; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006 ). Both 20N (Caballero et al. 2014; Furuya et al. 2006; Gr\\u00f6ner 2014) and 15N (Caballero et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2010; Terpstra et al. 2007; Planova filters and their combination (Gr\\u00f6ner et al. 2012; Koenderman et al. 2012 ) showed effective virus removal over a wide range of viral particle sizes (Table 1) . As a general rule, the removal efficiency of the filters increased with the ratio of pore size to virus size, as illustrated by Gr\\u00f6ner (2014) and Terpstra et al. (2007) . This was also demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2010) by filtrating poliovirus type 1 (a picorvanirus) through Planova filters manufactured with different pore sizes, ranging between 15 (LRV = 6.9) and 35 nm (LRV = 0.2). The two-filter combinations were globally more efficient than single filters at removing small viruses from spiked protein intermediates, though two 15N filters connected in parallel for tangential filtration (Koenderman et al. 2012) yielded LRVs quite similar to those obtained using 15N alone (Terpstra et al. 2006 ). Care should be taken when comparing vertically the data collected in Table 1 , however. In addition to the sizes of viral particles and filter pores, the results of such virus-spiking studies are dependent on a number of process parameters such as the filtration operating conditions (filtration mode, transmembrane pressure, volume per filter area, tempera-ture\\u2026), the characteristics of the product feed stream (pH, conductivity, nature and concentration of the product\\u2026), or else the purity level and concentration of the virus spike. Moreover, several studies include pre-filtration (Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012) or viral inactivation (Koenderman et al. 2012; Terpstra et al. 2006) in the calculation of LRVs. This variability in test conditions for filtration-based virus removal makes difficult any comparison between LRVs collected from multiple sources as in Table 1 , even though some results (Caballero et al. 2014; Hongo-Hirasaki et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2010 ) contradict its influence on filtration performance, underlining the robustness of the filtration process. Also, some variations in virus removal capacity may occur between commercial filter modules owing to their manufacture from different batches of HF, as illustrated by Roberts et al. (2010) for 15N filters.\\nLike membrane microfiltration, depth filtration is widely used as a clarification step in biopharmaceutical purification to ensure removal of cell debris, large aggregates and contaminants from the product stream prior to purification processes such as column/membrane chromatography and viral filtration/inactivation steps (Liu et al. 2010; van Reis and Zydney 2007; Vicente et al. Vicente et al. 2011a, b) . Commercially available depth filters currently employed in bioprocessing are composed of cellulose fibers with a porous inorganic filter aid and a resin binder, generally cationic. For instance, the Zeta Plus TM filter media (3 M Purification Inc.-formerly Cuno, Meriden, CT, USA) is composed of a cellulose fiber depth matrix containing silica-based filter-aid material and positively charged by chemical bounding of a cationic charge modifier (Ostreicher 1991) .\\nVarying retention ratings are available (0.1-1.0 lm). The triple layered A1HC filter media from EMD Millipore include two depth filtration layers (cellulose ? diatomaceous earth) of different grades and a 0.1 lm-pore-size microporous membrane pre-filter made of mixed cellulose esters (van Reis and Zydney 2007). Hence, these cellulosic depth filters rely on both size exclusion and electrostatic adsorptive binding to effect separation (Liu et al. 2010) . In viral spiking studies (Barnette et al. 2012; Dichtelm\\u00fcller et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2008) , they were found to retain viral particles whose surface is negatively charged over a wide range of pH as their isoelectric points (pI) range most frequently between 3.5 and 7.0, with a mean value of 5.0 \\u00b1 1.3 (Michen and Graule 2010) .\\nViruses are recognized as a major cause of waterrelated disease (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) . Enteric viruses, more particularly, which are associated primarily with gastrointestinal illness (Bosch et al. 2008; Fong and Lipp 2005; Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011) , are implied in most waterborne viral outbreaks (Gibson 2014; Hamza et al. 2011 ). All types of water, including waters used for drinking (surface or ground supplies), recreational waters (fresh, marine, and swimming pool), agricultural waters for irrigation (rivers and groundwater) and waste waters (sewage or industrial effluents), have been shown to be potential vehicles for virus transmission (Bosch et al. 2008) .\\nContamination is most frequently of fecal origin (Bosch et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2012) . Although viral levels may be high at the contamination source, e.g., concentrations ranging between 10 5 and 10 11 virus particles per gram of feces are referred to in the literature (Michen and Graule 2010) , viral concentrations as low as 1-10 viral particles per liter may be found in environmental water (Julian and Schwab 2012) . Since enteric viruses display high infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Julian and Schwab 2012) , such titers may constitute a health risk and should be detected for reliable surveillance of viral pathogens in water. As a consequence, efficient concentration methods are needed to capture viruses in large-volume water samples and release the retained viral material in concentrated form. Most common methods are based on filtration processes (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). In particular, virus adsorptionelution (viradel) filter methods have been widely implemented since the 1970s (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Briefly, in a viradel method, viruses from aqueous samples are reversibly adsorbed to microporous filters and then eluted from the filters in a small liquid volume (APHA, AWWA and WEF 1998). Adsorbent filters carry electrical charges and virus retention occurs via electrostatic interaction rather than by size exclusion. In other words, viradel filters act as depth filters rather than sieves. Contrary to viral filters that retain viruses by a sieving mechanism to achieve complete viral clearance, their pore size lies in the microporous range, which allows the high flow filtration necessary for virus capture in large water samples. Positively or negatively charged filters can be used in a viradel procedure, among which those made of cellulosic materials have been dominant over the last few decades.\\nSince their pI is below the pH of natural water (i.e., around neutrality) ( \\nHuang et al. (2000) Table 5 continued Filter type a Water nature No.\\n[0 tested earlier for concentration of viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 4 ). More recent studies made use of Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilters, however (Table 5 ). In these works, pure (e.g., distilled), tap, environmental or sewage water samples were seeded with varying enteric viruses that are common waterborne pathogens, i.e., members of the families Picornaviridae (polioviruses, coxsakieviruses, teschoviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses), Caliciviridae (noroviruses, caliciviruses) and Reoviridae (rotaviruses) (Fong and Lipp 2005) , or bacteriophages (enterobacteria phages) that are considered as alternative indicators of fecal contamination and as index organisms for the presence of enteric viruses in waters (Goodridge and Steiner 2012). Naturally contaminated waters containing sufficient levels of indigenous viruses, more particularly bacteriophages, were also used in addition to spiking studies sensu stricto (Table 4) . Following sample filtration, viral particles adsorbed to the filter were eluted in concentrated form using a variety of eluting solutions, the most common eluent consisting of a slightly alkaline (pH 9.0-9.5) protein solution (i.e., beef extract), frequently buffered with glycine-NaOH or another amino acid solution (sometimes supplemented with salt to aid disruption of electrostatic interactions between viruses and filters (Shields and Farrah 1983) , a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea) or a surfactant (e.g., Tween 80) to affect virus-filter hydrophobic interactions . Eluted viruses were quantified-using plaque titer assays, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Hamza et al. 2011)-to assess the recovery efficiency of the filtration step by comparing to input titers. This efficiency depends on a number of process parameters including the filter type and filtration conditions (e.g., filtration rate and pressure), the elution buffer composition and eluting conditions, the nature, input titer and titration method of the tested virus-in addition to the water matrix characteristics that may affect virus quantification and filter performance (Borchardt et al. 2013) . Hence, Tables 4 and 5 display a wide range of recovery yields. In practical tests aimed at the detection of naturallyoccurring viruses in field, large-volume water samples, the filtration (adsorption-elution) step is usually a primary concentration step which is followed by a secondary one to reach the virus detection threshold, e.g., organic flocculation or PEG precipitation (Lewis and Metcalf 1988) . The recovery yield of such two-step concentration processes was evaluated in several studies using seeded or naturally contaminated water samples (Tables 4, 5) . As a general rule, the viral loss due to secondary concentration was balanced by a huge increase in concentration factor allowing virus detection in water concentrates from large-volume samples, as reported by Chang et al. (1981) and Raphael et al. (1985) for indigenous enteroviruses in wastewater and rotaviruses in sewage-polluted surface water, respectively. After determining the optimal elution conditions for 1 MDS disk-adsorbed noroviruses following filtration of spiked distilled water samples, Lee et al. (2011) (Table 5 ) applied the optimized procedure to the detection of noroviruses in environmental water. They combined adsorptive filtration using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich viruses from largevolume surface (200 l) and ground (500 l) water samples. This integrated two-step process led to high volume reduction factors, i.e., 10,000 and 25,000 for surface and ground water samples, respectively (200-5009 for filtration, 509 for organic flocculation), but its recovery efficiency was not evaluated by spiking studies. In the same way, beside spiking Woo et al. (2012) . a Ratio of the virus survival factor in the treated filter to that in the untreated filter, where the virus survival factor in a filter is the number of viruses recovered by elution from the filter divided by the number of viruses removed by the filtration process. b PF PP filter from commercial surgical mask (DuPont TM 01361N), CCF coarse pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 54, 22 lm pore size), FCF fine pore cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50, 2.7 lm pore size) studies like those detailed in Table 5 , 1 MDS filter cartridges have been widely applied to concentrate enteric viruses in water samples of different origins (Table 6) , ranging from large-volume samples of weakly contaminated water intended for drinking or drinking water production (Borchardt et al. 2003 (Borchardt et al. , 2004 Lee et al. 2014; Sedmak et al. 2005; Verheyen et al. 2009 ) to wastewater samples with high viral content-to assess the virus removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Kuo et al. 2010; Simmons et al. 2011) . In these tests of field water samples for enteric viruses, 1 MDS filtration was mainly combined with second-stage concentration by organic flocculation as detailed by Fout et al. (2001) in the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) manual of methods for virology. The elution of filter-adsorbed viral particles was mostly performed with an alkaline beef extract solution supplemented or not with glycine (buffers EB3 and EB1 in Table 5 ). The work by Verheyen et al. (2009) is an exception to these common procedures. To concentrate viruses in small-volume samples from drinking water sources, these authors used two filter cartridges in series with no additional concentration step and an alkaline powdered milk solution as elution buffer. They found that 20% (3/15) and 13% (32/247) of surface and ground (well) water sources, respectively, were contaminated with adenoviruses, with very few samples positive to rotavirus (0/15 surface water samples, 6/247 well water sources). Despite the differences in virus concentration methods, these results compare with those obtained by Xagoraraki et al. (2007) and Cheong et al. (2009) for adenovirus detection in surface (14/58 samples, 24%) and ground water (4/29 samples, 14%), respectively. They also agree with data reported by Borchardt et al. (2003) and Cheong et al. (2009) showing the low contamination level of ground water by rotavirus. It is worth noting here, however, that the number of positive samples reported in these viral analyses of water (and the others quoted in Table 6 ) is dependent on the sensitivity of the detection techniques used to assess the presence of viruses, i.e., nucleic acid-based amplification methods such as conventional PCR, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR/RT-PCR or integrated cell culture PCR (ICC/PCR) to determine virus infectivity (Fong and Lipp 2005; Hamza et al. 2011, Mattison and Bidawid 2009; Watzinger et al. 2006) with different detection thresholds.\\nIt emerges from this glance at literature that cellulose-based electropositive filters are still commonly used for viral monitoring of water. These filters are expensive, however, and face competition with cheaper products, in particular nanoalumina fiber filters and glass wool filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . The former, NanoCeram TM filters manufactured by Argonide Corporation (Sanford, Fla., USA), are composed of nanosized (2 nm diameter), alumina-based {mainly boehmite, c-AlO(OH)} fibrilles dispersed in a microglass fiber matrix, resulting in an electropositive filter media with 2-3 lm average pore size Kaledin 2005, 2006) . The latter consist of commercial sodocalcic glass wool coated with mineral oil (type Bourre 725 QN/TECH Loose Wool, Isover Saint-Gobain, Courbevois, France), hand packed into columns or filter holders in the laboratory (Vilagin\\u00e8s et al. 1993) . These glass wool filters harbor electropositive sites while presenting hydrophobic surface characteristics. Efficient enrichment of (seeded or/ and) indigenous viruses from various water samples using NanoCeram (Gibbons et al. 2010; Ikner et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2012) , and glass wool (Deboosere et al. 2011; Lambertini et al. 2008; Wyn-Jones et al. 2011 ) filters has been reported in recent years (see also Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Wong et al. 2012) . Compared with 1 MDS filters (Table 5) , NanoCeram filters showed similar , slightly lower (McMinn 2013) or higher (Karim et al. 2009 ) virus concentration efficiency.\\nCommercially available under different pore sizes (0.025-8.0 lm), mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are negatively charged over a wide range of pH values, their overall negative charge increasing with pH (Kessick and Wagner 1978) . Microporous filters in the 0.1-0.45 lm pore size range have been used for ages in laboratory and industry for size-based filtration of bacterial particles and cell debris (surface filters). These and larger pore size filters have been shown to retain enteroviruses, however, despite the much smaller size of viral particles compared to the nominal mean diameter of filter pores (Cliver 1968 ). The presence of salts enhanced virus adsorption to cellulose ester membranes, this effect increasing with the cation valence (i.e., Al 3? [ Mg 2? [ Na ? ) (Wallis et al. 1972) . Acidification of the viral suspension also improved virus adsorption efficiency, even in the absence of exogenously added salts (Sobsey et al. 1973 ). These early results were later confirmed by Lukasik et al. (2000) , who investigated the influence of mono-, di-, and trivalent salts (NaCl, MgCl 2 , and AlCl 3 ) on the adsorption of poliovirus and enterobacteria phages to the MF-Millipore TM membrane filter type HA (0.45 lm pore size) and the electropositive 3M TM Zeta Plus TM 1 MDS microfilter at neutral or acidic pH. At pH 7, salts promoted virus adsorption to HA filter while affecting adsorption to 1 MDS filter. At pH 3.5, more than 95% of the viruses tested adsorbed to HA filter with or without salt added to the viral suspension-the salts interfering again with viral adsorption to 1MDS filter. Furthermore, the addition of urea or Tween 80 to the salt solution affected virus adsorption to both filters at pH 3.5 and HA filter at pH 7. In agreement with previous studies by the same group (Haramoto et al. 2004 (Haramoto et al. , 2005 Lukasik et al. (2000) explained these results by the antichaotropic effect of salts that increased hydrophobic interactions between filters and viruses and was impaired by the chaotropic agent or the detergent. At neutral pH, charge screeening by salt addition reduced electrostatic attractive and repulsive forces between viruses and 1 MDS or HA filter, respectively. Cation-mediated cross-complexation between negative groups on virus and filter surfaces (Kessick and Wagner 1978) and, more particularly, strengthened hydrophobic virusfilter interactions contributed to improving the adsorption efficiency of HA filter. At acidic pH, viruses displayed a positive surface charge and their electrostatic interactions with HA filter switched from repulsive to attractive-and inversely for electropositive 1 MDS filter. The presence of salt probably affected these interactions but was balanced by the promoting effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions.\\nHence, most tests reported so far for virus concentration from water samples using cellulose ester filters (essentially HA filters) have been performed after addition of multivalent cations (mainly Mg 2? ) to the water samples with or without pH adjustment to an acidic level. According to Katayama et al. (2002) , the virus-loaded filters were rinsed with an acidic solution to eliminate remaining cations before elution with NaOH or other alkaline buffers. Haramoto et al. (2004 Haramoto et al. ( , 2005 Haramoto et al. ( , 2007a proposed a variation in the method that consisted in pre-conditioning the filter with Al 3? ions. Aluminum chloride was passed through the filter, making an electropositive ion coating, which avoided cation addition to the water sample. The recovery efficiency of both protocols has been evaluated by seeding water samples with enteric viruses and bacteriophages and quantifying eluted viruses (Table 7) . Similarly to spiking studies (Tables 4, 5) and viral analyses of field water samples (Table 6 ) with electropositive filters, the HA-based filtration/elution process was frequently associated with a secondary concentration step to increase virus concentration factors. Here, centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) using commercial Millipore (Centriprep \\u00d2 , Centricon \\u00d2 or Amicon \\u00d2 ) concentrators was the elective concentration method. These CU units contain a low adsorptive regenerated cellulose membrane (Ultracel \\u00d2 ) whose nominal molecular-weight cutoff ranges between 3 and 100 kDa-a MWCO value of 50 kDa being most frequently selected for secondary concentration of eluted viruses. They are routinely used in laboratories to purify and concentrate biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids from small-volume biological samples (e.g., 2-15 ml for the Centriprep filter unit). Tested or not for virus recovery by spiking experiments, the combined concentration procedures have been extended to the detection of enteric viruses in field water samples including tap (Haramoto et al. 2004 ), sea (Katayama et al. 2002) , river (surface) (Fong et al. 2010; Hamza et al. 2009; Haramoto et al. 2005 ) and waste (Fong et al. 2010; Katayama et al. 2008 ) water (Table 8) . Samples with different volumes were collected according to the water source, i.e., sample volumes increased as the expected contamination level decreased. For instance, Katayama et al. (2002) applied HA filtration, followed by acid rinse of the filter, viral elution with NaOH and secondary concentration of the eluate by CU, to concentrate naturally occurring viruses (noroviruses, enteroviruses and HAV-hepatitis A virus) in seawater samples. Based on the volume reduction factor (2-l sample/2 ml final concentrate, i.e., 1000) and the recovery yield of the two-step process (Table 7) , a virus concentration factor of 670 was reached. Only HAV virus was not detected in any sample tested. Later on, Katayama et al. (2008) followed the same protocol to concentrate enteric viruses in the raw influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Samples of 100-ml volume were collected and submitted to the two-step concentration process, yielding a volume reduction factor of c. 140. The four tested kinds of enteric viruses were detected in all 72 wastewater samples but one lacking norovirus GI (NoV GI). Using PEG precipitation as the secondary concentration step, Hamza et al. (2009) tested river water samples for contamination by enteric viruses and bacteriophages. A volume reduction factor of 5000 (10-l sample/2 ml final concentrate) and virus concentration factors ranging between 1000 (norovirus) and 5000 (adenovirus) (see Table 7 for recovery yields) were obtained. All 41 analyzed samples were found positive for enteric viruses. Human adenovirus and norovirus were detected in 97.5 and 32% of the samples, respectively. Haramoto et al. (2004) illustrated the ability of Al 3? -coated filters to concentrate viruses from large-volume freshwater samples without salt addition by detecting noroviruses in tap water from Tokyo University. Tap water samples (303-l average volume) underwent two successive filtration/elution steps using 293-mm and 47-mm diameter HA filters prior to concentration by CU (final volume: 0.9 ml), which ensured a volume reduction factor higher than 300,000. However, the virus recovery efficiency of the 3-step concentration process was not evaluated. Ten of the 98 tested samples were found positive for noroviruses. These results compare to those reported by Lee et al. (2011) ( Table 5 ) using 1 MDS cartridge with organic flocculation to enrich noroviruses from large surface and ground water samples.\\nDespite these promising data, the two viradel methods based on electronegative filters (i.e., addition of MgCl 2 to water samples or filter coating with Al 3? ions before filtration) have been essentially implemented for viral analysis of waters containing high amounts of indigenous viruses, requiring limited sample volumes (Table 8 )-electropositive filter cartridges being more adapted to virus concentration from large volumes of weakly contaminated water (Table 6 ). Beside the above-mentioned work by Haramoto et al. (2004) , only two studies among those detailed in Table 8 describe virus detection in environmental water samples with low viral content, namely drinking water sources after chlorination or without treatment (Rigotto et al. 2010 ) and groundwater from artesian wells (Chironna et al. 2012) . Both studies used small-volume samples and CU as secondary concentration step, yielding a modest volume reduction factor of 1000. Very few from 202 artesian well water samples were found positive to the tested enteric viruses: none for HAV and enterovirus, 1 for rotavirus and 4 for norovirus (Chironna et al. 2012) . A large proportion (50%) of samples from drinkingwater supplies was positive to adenovirus, however (Rigotto et al. 2010) . These data are compatible with viral analyses of groundwater and water intended for drinking performed using 1 MDS filtration as the first virus concentration step (Table 6 ). It should be noted, however, that the same remark applies to data collected in Table 8 as to those in Table 6 concerning the numbers of virus-positive samples, i.e., their dependence on the virus detection method. This can be illustrated by the two following examples. Using ICC-PCR (measuring infectious viruses), Katayama et al. (2002) detected enteroviruses in 4 of 6 seawater samples from bathing beach, but no sample was found positive by direct RT-PCR. De Paula et al. (2007) found 48/52 river water samples positive for HAV by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, but only 12/52 by nested RT-PCR.\\nAs attested by the large body of literature data quoted above, virus adsorption-elution methods using electropositive or electronegative filters are routinely applied to the primary concentration of waterborne viruses, each type of filter possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. Ultrafiltration is considered another filtration-based option to concentrate viruses from water samples (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013; Ikner et al. 2012 ). It has been indicated earlier that CU with microconcentrators based on cellulose ultrafiltration discs is commonly used as a secondary concentration step following the viradel process. Hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), however, is considered a potential technique for primary concentration of viruses from large-volume water samples, yielding better virus recoveries than the viradel method performed with either electropositive or electronegative filters (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013) . Commercial HFUF devices operated in cross-flow mode have been applied to the simultaneous concentration of biological particles, including viruses, spiked in tap (Polaczyk et al. 2008) or reclaimed (Liu et al. 2012) water samples, to virus recovery from seeded tap (Rhodes et al. 2011 ) and estuarine (Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ) water samples, and also, more rarely, to virus recovery from field water samples (Grassi et al. 2010; Hernandez-Morga et al. 2009 ). Most of these devices are dialyzers that contain synthetic HF made from polysulfone. Following the early work by Belfort et al. (1976) showing that polysulfone HF membranes were superior to cellulose acetate ones for virus concentration, virus concentration experiments using HFUF dialyzers equipped with HF manufactured from cellulose are scarce. An example is given by Liu et al. (2012) . They showed that the Exeltra Plus 210 cellulose triacetate HF dialyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) and the Optiflux \\u00d2 F200NR polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Walthamm, MA, USA) provided similar recovery efficiencies for MS2 and UX174 bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from spiked 10-l and 100-l samples of reclaimed water.\\nAn array of viral infections can be transmitted by the airborne route, in particular via aerosols (droplet nuclei) Tang et al. 2006; Tellier 2006; Verreault et al. 2008 ). Even though virus inactivation rates in the atmosphere are generally higher than those of bacterial and fungal contaminants, virus-containing aerosols can spread worldwide (Despr\\u00e9s et al. 2012) . The threat of viral outbreaks and pandemics such as those caused by SARS coronavirus (Yu et al. 2004 ) and highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus (Tellier 2006) , allied with the fear of bioterrorism using viruses (e.g., smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses) (Barras and Greub 2014) as biological weapons, has encouraged the search for efficient protection equipment against aerosolized virus-containing particles.\\nIndividual respiratory protective devices consist in respirators, i.e., air-filtering face masks designed to protect the wearer against inhalation of a hazardous atmosphere (here airborne infectious aerosols)-opposing to surgical masks designed to protect the environment from contaminants generated by the wearer's exhaled breath (i.e., prevention of surgical infections) . Currently, most ''filtering facepiece'' (FFP) respirators have a multilayer composite structure with a central filtering layer displaying electret properties (Gralton and McLaws 2010) . These electret filters (Thakur et al. 2013) are produced by imparting an electrostatic charge to a nonwoven fibrous mat composed of synthetic polymer fibers such as poly(propylene) (PP) (mainly), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(carbonate) fibers. Electrostatic charging of the filter media is commonly obtained by corona discharge, triboelectrification and electrostatic spinning (Tsai et al. 2002) . Electret filters collect particles through the combined action of mechanical and electrostatic forces (Podg\\u00f3rski 2010; Wang 2001 (CEN 2000) should retain respectively at least 95 and 94% of influent particles (NaCl particles are used as nonbiological surrogate particles) (Rengasamy et al. 2009 ). First worn by surgical teams a hundred years ago to prevent bacterial contamination of patient's open wounds, early surgical masks were constructed from layers of cellulose materials, more particularly cotton cellulose (gauze) (Haller and Colwell 1918) and derivatives (Arnold 1938 ) (see also Belkin 1997) . Much more recently, face masks made from cotton fabrics have been tested as alternative respiratory protective equipment against pandemic outbreaks such as influenza (Dato et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2013; Rengasamy et al. 2010) . Like respirators, current commercially available surgical face masks include several layers of non-woven fabrics with, frequently, a cellulose inner layer in contact with the wearer's face to improve wearer's comfort. However, the filtering layer, usually made of meltblown fibers (Ghosh 2014) , is devoid of electret properties. Since particulate filtration is only mechanical, i.e., less efficient than that of respirators, most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices, standard tests to evaluate their filtration efficacy being less stringent (Oberg and Brosseau 2008) .\\nWhile a number of studies have confirmed that surgical masks logically offer lower protection than respirators against aerosol particles, the effectiveness of both types of face masks at preventing viral respiratory infection, in particular influenza, is still a matter of controversy (Bin-Reza et al. 2012; Cowling et al. 2010; Gralton and McLaws 2010) . The improper facial fit of respirators Coia et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2007 ) may affect their protection efficiency against infectious aerosols. It allows particulate flows outside the filtration area of the mask, resulting in face-seal leaks, i.e., the leakage of infectious particles around the edges of the mask (Grinshpun et al. 2009; Lei et al. 2013) . Mask seal leakage can be minimized by applying existing guidelines for correct donning and fit checking of respirators . Moreover, human face and head form models have been proposed as a tool for designing respirators with improved protection efficiency, simulating interactions between faces and facemasks and describing their fit (Golshahi et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2012) . The accumulation of viral particles at the surface and within the filtration media of respirators, where they can remain viable and infectious for extended periods of time (Coulliette et al. 2013; Sakaguchi et al. 2010) , is another significant problem with which respirator wearers are confronted in the prevention of viral transmission and spread. Incorrect mask handling by the wearer may lead to accidental self-inoculation, cross-contaminations affecting both other healthcare workers and patients, and contamination of fomites (Casanova et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the risk of virus reaerosolization from respirators during extended use, if limited, cannot be ruled out (Fisher et al. 2012) . Recommendations for respirator doffing do exist but have proven insufficient to prevent virus transfer from respirator to healthcare employees' hands and clothing (Casanova et al. 2008) . Adding antiviral properties to the filtration process may contribute to limit the risk of viral transmission by improper handling of used respirators. A number of virucidal facemasks have been developed and patented over the past 15 years (Tiliket et al. 2011) , some of which are commercially available. In the SpectraShield TM Plus respirator masks designed by Nexera Medical Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) (Haas 2008), for instance, two layers of filter media are sandwiched between (inner and outer) antimicrobial layers where a silver-copper zeolite (carrier) antimicrobial agent (Agion \\u00d2 antimicrobial, Sciessent LLC, Wakefield, Mass.) is embedded around the core of synthetic fibers (Fosshield \\u00d2 , Foss Manufacturing, Hampton, NH). The Biofriend TM Biomask TM FFP respirator, manufactured by Filligent Ltd. (Hong Kong) and distributed by Medline Industries, Inc. (Mundelein, Ill.) , is another four-layered device in which the melt-blown PP filtration layer is inserted between an inner layer of spunbond PP and two antiviral layers, namely a cellulose/polyester layer containing copper and zinc ions and an outer layer of spunbond PP treated with a low pH (citric acidacidified) hydrophilic plastic coating (Davison 2012; Stewart et al. 2014) . The outer layer absorbs infectious aerosol droplets and viruses are denaturated by exposure to citric acid. In the second layer, inactivation of viruses with damaged structures is completed by the virucidal effect of divalent metal cations. Contributing to the overall antiviral efficiency of the structure, the cellulosic component of this layer is a sulphated or sulfonated rayon fabric (Stewart et al. 2012 (Stewart et al. , 2014 to which a variety of viral human pathogens bind via the cationic sites of viral envelopes/capsids.\\nBeside the commercial Biomask TM respirator, various composite structures designed for filtrationinactivation of airborne microbial contaminants, where cellulosic materials play an active antimicrobial role, have been patented in recent years Bernard 2006; Nakamura and Nakamura 2011; Tsutsumi 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Zhong 2011) . Several of them are based on bacterial cellulose layers/coatings provided with an antimicrobial component, i.e., silver (Zhong 2011) or zeolite-supported silver (Nakamura and Nakamura 2011) nanoparticles, and chitosan (Zhang et al. 2012) . The respiratory protective mask described by Zhong (2011) comprises a three-layer bacterial cellulose membrane whose middle layer contains silver nanoparticles. The antimicrobial facemask invented by Nakamura and Nakamura (2011) includes two base cloth elements both of which are made of a woven textile (gauze), a nonwoven cellulose fabric (e.g., rayon), or a porous sheet (e.g., a 0.3-0.5 mm sliced sheet of urethane sponge). The first base cloth is filled with bacterial cellulose nanofibers that retain silver zeolite and a humectant (e.g., trehalose or 1,3-butylene glycol) in their network structure. Additional antimicrobial properties are provided to the mask by impregnating the second base cloth with a carboxylic acid (e.g., citric acid). Zhang et al. (2012) also used bacterial cellulose in a composite antimicrobial material suitable for respiratory protective masks. A nonwoven polymer fabric Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2017) 16:455-489 479 was coated with a film of bacterial cellulose mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol)-to improve the film-forming properties, mechanical strength and air permeability of the coating-and chitosan, a non-sulfated polysaccharide produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin that displays strong antibacterial potency (Kong et al. 2010; Rabea et al. 2003 ) and, to a lesser extent, antiviral activity (Rabea et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2012 ).\\nIn the antimicrobial air filtration device proposed by Bernard (2006) , cellulose derivatives-more particularly, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), a common pharmaceutical excipient for enteric coating of tablets and capsules with antiviral activity (Pirrone et al. 2011 )-were used as ''biocidal prophylactic compounds'' to provide the classical filter media (e.g., a nonwoven PP web, electrostatically charged or not) with antimicrobial properties. Cellulose derivatives could be incorporated as fibers or particles (micronized fibers) into the air filtration device either in a separate layer positioned before or after the filter media, or deposited onto the outer surface of the filter media relative to the air flow direction. To illustrate this invention, handsheets prepared from CAP fibers intermixed or not with CAP particles were successfully tested for virucidal efficacy by exposure to an aerosol challenge of enterobacteria phage \\u00d8X174.\\nBy exploiting the antimicrobial properties of dialdehyde polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose dialdehydes, Baney et al. (2012) proposed a new method for producing low-cost virucidal filters suitable for respiratory protective masks. The treatment of a standard cellulose filter paper (Whatman TM Grade 50 filter paper) with sodium periodate improved its antiviral potency due to oxidation of some cellulose to dialdehyde cellulose inside the filter. Challenged with aerosols of MS2 enterobacteria phage at high relative humidity (90% at 23\\u00b0C), the treated filter showed higher filtration efficiency than a control, untreated one, i.e., better removal of viable viral particles (Plaque Forming Units) joined to a lower resistance to air flow (pressure drop)-due to increased pore size distribution (Woo et al. 2011) . Higher inactivation of MS2 virus by the treated filter was also highlighted, confirming an improvement of its disinfection capability (Woo et al. 2011 ). However, the filtration and inactivation of airborne viruses were less effective at lower moisture content of the filter, i.e., at air humidity levels commonly encountered in hospital settings, in particular operating rooms (Balaras et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, the inhalation resistance of the treated filter remained too high for application to respiratory protective masks. The same pros and cons apply to cellulose paper filters treated by immersion into aqueous suspensions of dialdehyde starch (DAS) (Woo et al. 2012) . While this treatment did not affect the removal efficiency of viable MS2 viruses from aerosols at high relative humidity, virus survival on the treated filters was reduced (Fig. 5 ) and the pressure drop decreased as DAS concentration increased. The drop in air flow resistance remained insufficient for practical application to respirators. DAS treatment of a PP filter from a commercial FFP mask did not modify the filtration parameters (virus removal efficiency and pressure drop) of the filter but significantly improved its biocidal efficacy (Fig. 5 )-an opening of this treatment towards the development of virucidal facemasks. Another example of cellulose filter material treated with cellulose derivatives to yield antiviral properties is given by Tsurumi (Tsutsumi 2009 ). This inventor devised a low-cost virucidal mask filter made of a standard cellulose nonwoven fabric impregnated with water extracts of sulfonated or aminated styrenegraft cellulose. To reinforce the water retention properties of the filter media, a superabsorbent resin such as poly(acrylic acid) was added to the graft cellulose extract before impregnation of the fabric or incorporated into a separate layer covering the impregnated fabric. Low (hydrogen ions from sulfonic acid groups) or high (hydroxyl ions generated by aminated groups) pH conditions inside the hydrated material were claimed to make it virucidal against influenza A virus and caliciviruses. The patent gives no illustration of such antiviral properties, however.\\nStudies published by Tiliket et al. (2011) and Catel-Ferreira et al. (2015) present another type of cellulosebased material for airborne virus filtration in which a low-cost nonwoven cellulose material, i.e., commercial Kimwipes \\u00d2 (KW) wipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., Dallas, Tex.), was chemically modified by coating with a synthetic polymer, i.e., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Tiliket et al. 2011) or grafting of an antiviral agent, i.e., catechin (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) . The filtration efficiency of the modified filter media was first tested on aerosolized T4D viruses (Enterobacteria phage T4, Doermann's strain T4D). Then the treated filter was inserted inside a commercial medical mask in place of its cellulosic layer (Kolmi M24001 mask, Kolmi-Hopen, Saint-Barth\\u00e9l\\u00e9my-d'Anjou, France), and the reconstructed mask was challenged with TD4 aerosols to evaluate its virus removal efficiency. Both treatments significantly improved the virus capture factor (ratio of upstream to downstream PFU contents) of KW cellulose wipes and of reconstructed commercial masks compared to original masks and to masks reconstructed with untreated wipes. In these studies, the breathability of reconstructed masks was not quantified, nor was the virus survivability on the modified filter media. However, additional filtration experiments using aerosols of influenza A virus (low pathogenic H5N2 strain) showed that challenged viral particles accumulated in PEI functionalized KW layers with no loss in number and infectivity (Tiliket et al. 2011) . Thus these modified masks showed no virucidal effect, the PEImodified layers behaving like an electret media owing to the polycationic character of PEI. On the other hand, since catechin and catechin-grafted wipes showed antiviral activity against T4D viruses in liquid media (Catel-Ferreira et al. 2015) , it may be assumed that part of viruses accumulated in excess in the treated wipes were inactivated by the polyphenol agent, i.e., the reconstructed masks were actually virucidal.\\nDespite these few examples, the use of cellulosic media in filtration devices aimed at the capture of airborne viral particles remains now very limited compared to filtration of virus-contaminated liquid samples. While patented, several cellulose-based, virucidal filter media designed for insertion in air filtering face masks have not been commercially developed yet.\\nBesides the wearing of personal respiratory protective equipment, another aspect of the fight against airborne infections lies in the decontamination of indoor air in healthcare facilities, and, more generally, of air processed through heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the built environment. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are the primary technology used for particulate removal in these collective protection devices-allied with UV irradiation, ozonation or air ionization to yield indoor air decontamination (Bolashikov and Melikov 2009; Jacob et al. 2013 )-and may be complemented with a photytocatalyst such as TiO 2 to improve the inactivation of accumulated microorganisms Pigeot-Remy et al. 2014 ). Since HEPA filters are essentially made of glass fibers, they are beyond the scope of this review and their virus-retentive properties will not be detailed further.\\nMost frequently associated with other virus reduction (virus clearance of biopharmaceuticals) or concentration (viral analysis of water) steps, size-exclusion and/ or adsorptive (charge mediated) filtration is an essential tool to fight against viral contaminants in aqueous media. Owing to inherent properties of cellulose, including mechanical strength and hydrophilicity (that opposes protein adsorption and biofouling), allied with widespread availability and biocompatibility, cellulose-based materials are still widely present in viral filters. Developed commercially over the past thirty years, several cellulosic filter media have been and continue to be used for both routine analyses in laboratories and academic research studies aimed at improving the filtration performance, generating a wealth of data quantifying the efficiency of virus removal or recovery/concentration from biologic or water samples, respectively.\\nAs concerns biopharmaceutical compounds, these data arise from validation studies of the filtration step performed by spiking intermediate biologic solutions (mostly blood proteins) from multistage purification processes with known titers of viral particles. Regenerated cellulose HF Planova filters N15-N35, operated in the dead-end mode as a single filter or two units in series, were shown to provide LRV values ranging between 4 and 7, on the average. Increasingly tested since their launching in 1989, these cellulosic filters compete with filter media made of synthetic polymers such as PVDF (e.g., Viresolve \\u00d2 NFP-Normal Flow Parvovirus-from EMD Millipore; Ultipor \\u00d2 VF Grade DV20/DV50 from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) or PES (e.g., Millipore Viresolve \\u00d2 Pro; Virosart \\u00d2 HS/HC/CPV from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). The hydrophilic nature of cellulose fibers is a definite advantage of Planova filters over others for virus removal from protein solutions, minimizing flux decline due to proteindominated filter plugging (cake formation) at constant pressure (normal-flow) filtration (Rathore et al. 2014 ). However, they are usually operated at lower flow rate than filters made of synthetic polymers whose operating pressure is higher. Hydrophilic modified PVDF membrane filters designed for virus removal from high-concentration protein solutions at high flow rate are being developed by several manufacturers, including Asahi-Kasei (i.e., Planova TM BioEX filters, launched in 2009).\\nMany studies have also been reported to assess the virus concentration efficiency of the viradel method using spiked water samples, prior to the detection of waterborne viral contaminants in field water samples. In this method, cellulosic filters, whether positively or negatively charged, are used for adsorptive capture of viruses before virus recovery by elution with a lowvolume eluent. Electropositive filters are more particularly suitable for virus capture in low-contaminated, high-volume water samples, e.g., samples of groundwater or source water for drinking water production ( Table 6) . Though routinely used, these filters are expensive and face competition with nanoalumina fiber filters (e.g., the patented Ahlstrom Disruptor \\u00d2 electroadsorptive filter) (Levi 2011 ) and glass wool filters, which are cheaper. On the other hand, efficient virus adsorption by electronegative filters-the standard, cost-effective mixed cellulose ester membrane microfilters-requires impractical sample pre-treatment: their use is limited to viral analysis of highlycontaminated waters, for which small-volume samples are sufficient (Table 8) .\\nCellulose nanomaterials may represent a promising perspective for cellulosic materials in their application to viral filtration of liquid samples, yielding filtration membranes with higher mechanical strength, water permeability, surface hydrophilicicy and resistance to biofouling (Carpenter et al. 2015) . Ma et al. (2011) have presented a composite membrane consisting of an electrospun poly(acrylonitrile) nanofibrous scaffold deposited on a non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) support. This two-layered membrane was coated by a layer of cellulose nanofibers and tested for retention of MS-2 phages. At acidic pH, phage particles were adsorbed by the negatively charged cellulose nanofiber coating, yielding a LRV value [3.7. Later on, the same nanofibrous composite membrane was doped with cellulose nanofibers functionalized by grafting with poly(vinylamine) . MS-2 phages were adsorbed at neutral pH onto positively charged amino-modified nanofibers, with a LRV value of 4. Metreveli et al. (2014) and Asper et al. (2015) have presented a size-exclusionbased filter paper made of pure cellulose nanofibers for removal of swine influenza A and murine leukemia viruses, respectively. These non-woven materials could be tailored to ensure efficient virus retention (Gustafsson and Mihranyan 2016a). Self assembled into nanosheets to yield ''mille feuille'' structures, they showed efficient removal of parvoviruses (Gustafsson et al. 2016b) : maybe a new filtration media for viral clearance?\\nA number of air filtration devices designed for individual protection against airborne viruses also include cellulosic materials. While published data on the filtration performance of cellulosic media for removal of viruses from air are scarce, industrial research is more apparent, in particular in Asian countries (China, Japan) where airborne pollution is a matter of great concern-the main objective being to add virucidal properties to the filtration media so as to inactivate accumulated viral particles. Therefore, some innovative media have been patented over the past few years with, however, no commercial development to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1405,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Radoshevich, Lilliana.
